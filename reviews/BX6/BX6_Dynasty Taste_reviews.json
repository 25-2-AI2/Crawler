It could use some paint and remove the clutter to make it feel more inviting. Despite it's sketchy appearance the gentleman behind the counter is pleasant and helpful. They serve your typical Chinese American dishes however, they also offer Japanese style and Korean style of the popular dishes which adds to the variety. The food is tasty and the Korean style sauce is my favorite. All the dishes I had from here always tasted freshly cooked except the fries (hit or miss). I would definitely order from here again."

However, they IGNORED the directions to add scallions to my egg drop soup. The egg roll was clearly cooked in old, stale oil."

I was on the phone with him while he ordered the food and the employee he spoke to seemed nice. Everything was delicious. I usually put barbecue sauce on my rice but this rice wasn’t dry and didn’t need it . The chicken was crispy and perfectly seasoned. The spare rib tips weren’t tough and the barbecue sauce on it was so good. The only thing is they put vegetables in their rice so if that’s not your thing then ask for no vegetables."
