The street tacos are TO DIE FOR—bursting with authentic Mexican flavors 🌯🔥 and made with so much corazón 💖. They even bring two AMAZING homemade hot sauces to the table with your tacos that add the perfect kick! 🌶️😋 Everything’s crafted in-house, and you can taste the passion in every dish! The restaurant is super clean 🧼, the service is TOP-NOTCH 🙌, and our waitress was an absolute STAR ✨—she gave awesome menu suggestions 📋 and really nailed what we were craving. If you’re hungry for traditional Mexican street food, this family-owned spot is a MUST-VISIT! 🚀 I’m already dreaming of my next meal here, and their catering, pickup, and delivery on Uber Eats, Grubhub, and DoorDash make it so easy to enjoy! 🛵🍽️ Highly recommend! 🎉 #TacoHeaven"

They always add a generous amount of meat, and I like to customize it by adding cheese and corn. Honestly, I do wish those extras came with it by default, because without them, the noodles and meat can feel a little plain. Still, the broth and the birria itself are incredibly flavorful, and that makes all the difference.\n\nI also tried the surf and turf tacos with cheese, and they were absolutely delicious—packed with flavor and perfectly cooked. The guacamole is another highlight—always fresh-tasting and a great side to any dish.\n\nThe only downside is the seating—it can feel a bit crowded and noisy inside, especially during peak times. But overall, the food quality makes up for it. I’ll definitely keep coming back."

Gave me the long churros and didn’t even add the strawberries on top like in online pictures. Lack of presentation was disappointing for the price.\n\nThe ice cream was frozen cold and I had to wait for it to melt a little before I could eat it. The strawberries were stuck to the bottom of the plastic cup they were in so definitely were sitting in the fridge for too long. The waitress was judgmental. Not worth going at all\n\nUpdate: After the taqueria’s response to my review they asked me to send an email with my situation. I sent a detailed email and never heard back. Very unprofessional and lacks customer service."

            "text": "got the birria tacos ($16 for 3), strawberry lemonade that was about $5, and churro bites with dulce de leche sauce for $7.\n\nthe tacos were incredible, i asked for some sour cream on the side and wow! so good. the consommé was fantastic as well.\n\nstrawberry lemonade was good, no complaints.\n\nthe churro bites were fine, the dulce de leche sauce didn’t taste like anything, kinda sad about that. worth the $7? no.\n\nmy waitress was alright, she was very attentive the only issue is that she comes off as very passive aggressive with the way she talks to the guests. i was seeing how she spoke to others just to make sure she wasn’t being that way only to me. other than that, again, she was fine!\n\ni would highly recommend this place either way,, too bad i live far from this place, otherwise id be here all the time!"

The birria tacos, guac and chips were FANTASTIC! The margaritas were also very tasty. I’ve had a lot of tacos, but these were the BEST I’ve ever had."

I’ve been here a couple times and the food & service has always been great. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food they serve you and i will continue coming here as a happy customer! :)"

The beef consommé was lacking flavor. I was really excited to try the surf and turf quesataco but it mainly tasted like cheese, not enough seasoning. I do appreciate the shrimp size, not small like most restaurants but it was 2 instead of 3. Didn’t get the sauces I requested. The chicken tinga tostada was good. Flavored and seasoned. I’ll order again and try something different."

Food was actually fresh and hit the spot. Only thing is, service was kinda slow — looked like the waiter was running the whole floor solo.\n\nNow the drinks? Straight syrup. Barely tasted any liquor, so that was a letdown.\n\nOverall, food was solid, vibes were chill, but they need more staff and way better drinks."

            "text": "Shout out to our waiter🙌🏻 the restaurant had him serving tables, taking everyone’s order and had to sit everyone who walked in today on his own. His team saw him struggling and did not offer to help he even had to clean the tables when people were leaving. Though he struggled due to the lack of help he still smiled at everyone and was not rude unlike the young lady in the register who declined to charge our card. Me and my sister had to get up to pay for our food at the register as the place kept getting busier and the waiter was unable to provide us with a bill at the moment. I felt so bad for him, there was about 7 girls behind the bar just standing there including another man with tattoos who also declined to assist the waiter with the tables. My sister lost her cool in there and spoke up for the worker. I feel like team work is everything I get it people are tired and don’t want to work but customer service is everything. None of the customers who walked in were greeted by any staff aside from the waiter who had to sit them down. The ladies in the register were very passive aggressive and did not want to charge our order they wanted the waiter to do it on top of all the work that he was doing by himself. The food here actually taste very good and I love their frozen drinks I really do hope a higher up could investigate this and train the team on being a team, the importance of helping one another out in order to have a successful business. Remember every customer that walks in is revenue to keep your business open and to keep your jobs. Hope you guys do better🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼"
