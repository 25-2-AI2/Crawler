The tres leches dessert was amazing. They were very well presented and the flavors were great. I did not like the uncomfortable wooden chairs though. After sitting for two hours let’s just say my hips hurt until the next morning lol. Also, this is the third restaurant I go to in the Tremont area where there’s hookah service. It is very annoying when you have smoke being blown in your area when you are trying to enjoy your meal. They should have a section for it and/or offer it after a certain time. Safe to say these restaurants are not kid friendly anymore and more smoker friendly."

The staff was attentive and made sure that we were comfortable.\n\nThe brunch menu featured a nice variety, but the salmon was the undeniable star of the show—moist, flavorful, and seasoned to perfection!.\n\nAnd let’s talk about the drinks!

Lets start with the appetizer had the guacamole and it had something else in it that took that taste guacamole taste away could be too much oil. Was not flavored only in some parts not every bite.  Me and my wife ordered steak asked for medium well and they burnt it not juicy at all. I ordered surf and turf and the shrimp was cold all 4 of them but I was starving so I still ate because at end of the day was cooked but that was horrible.  Now to the part where they taking the money.  The drinks are $18 a drink but they are serving juice. Ain’t no way that I order a drink that has Hennessy inside and the drink is still yellow and I drink so I can taste that no alcohol is inside.  We complain so much and the server did what he can do but at this point I truly believe the bartender was told to do the old trick that you add liquor to the more drinks they buy. We order 8 drinks in total and on the very last drink was the color changed smh. We looked up this spot to watch the game so of course I didn’t want to leave because it was all about my team but they don’t care about nothing but money and you can tell. The server was very nice again and sad that he has to work the way he did if they not going to provide him with what the customers asked for. All who follow my post know that I do not lie and I guess you will have to see for yourself. Hopefully after this post things will change but no way $18 should be paid for a drink that’s 99% juice until you order more. Receipt don’t like 8 drinks and still walked out with no buzz"

The flavors were spot-on, and you could tell they use quality ingredients.\n\nWhat really stood out to me, though, was the incredible service. Ali, the general manager, truly cares about his customers. He made sure everyone was well taken care of and created an inviting atmosphere that made the experience even more special.\n\nIf you’re looking for a place with great food, music, and an overall fantastic vibe, Aqua é Coco is the spot to go!

It was great music selection and great vibes from the dj. For me, it's going to be a regular Monday spot for me, place Is nicely decorated, nice decor, and would like it if they dim down lights a little way too bright (just a suggestion) the service is ok took a long time for the food and drinks, waiter was overwhelmed but julissa tried her best to keep up with the tables, definitely need more staff, bartender was great and served good drinks, food was amazing expect the Churrasco I'm steak person so it was definitely not it. But the burgers, tho, im will rate them burgers the best damn burgers in the bronx. As for the other food and appetizers, it was absolutely amazing. Despite the minor bumps in the road that can easily be fixed. This place is a gem. You must go and try it out. You won't be disappointed. See you guys next Monday. Is it Monday yet?

The food was so good I had to purchase addt'l food to take home and based on what I saw in the bag it's a nice portion. The only one issue we had was that the chicken was cooked too hard, but it was good, tho lol. We'll definitely come back again.  Thank you, Carlos!!! 😊"

They automatically hit you for 18% gratuity whether it's one or more persons. If the tip is mandatory, GIVE GOOD SERVICE! They took forever to come to the table to get the drink orders. Instead we waited very long and we gave our entire order at that point. In any restaurant, the moment the guest sits, you take the drink order. No, not this one. If people have to sit and wait, take their drink order immediately."

No one can to tell us about a table , i asked tgen they started looking. Tgey stopped looking then I saw a table availalible abd ibquired, they said it was reserve. Finally I found my own table and tell the greeters. They said fine. We sat there for over 40 minutes chatting and finishing tge drinks ee biught at the bar. No one came over and asked us anything. We tried to stop a server and he said give him a minute. Again and hour and change and one came. No utensils napkins or even water was given. We got up and walked out. We ended up st Havana were it was also crowded  but at least we hot s tanle in 30 minutes and enjoyed a great meal. I will never recommend this pkace to anyone!"

What’s the secret?!\n\nShoutout Nate for your exceptional service. Looking forward to the next time we get to celebrate there!"

It’s a large location with plenty of perfect seating available. It was raining when we visited so we sat inside for brunch from 1pm until 4pm. Our waitress was very pleasant friendly and tentative. Brunch is great with timed mimosas or sangrias included in their $34.99 deal. The portions I will say are small for sharing so order your own food."
