Another mixed parent asked can they speak English as well cause she doesn’t understand Spanish and he said i don’t speak English and he was the host of the party on the microphone doing dance battles with the kids and when the mixed kids dance the crowd wouldn’t cheer them on and it was very hurtful for the kids it showed the embarrassment and let’s not forget only Dominican music was played . Only 1 English song played which was the cha cha slide and 1 Afro beat song which was Joanna . But very bad experience speaking from a mixed parent as well ."

The place is huge with TVs and awesome decor.  The music was definitely my style but not the wifes.  The waitress was great in the begining but never checked up on us after bringing the food.  Not a big deal since we had no issues.  We really liked the food and the prices were not bad.  Drinks were pretty good also.  It started to get busy as it was a Friday and I assume people show up after work because the bar got packed.  We didn't stay much more than an hr or so but we liked it there.  I would come back but only at opening.  I dont think the place would be OK for us the later it got."

Meaning heavy pours on the alcohol. The service was as expected, inattentive and distracted. The music was deafening and I went there at 4 pm. As a lounge only this place would be great.

We all arrived to boca together at about 2:55pm. We communicated to the host we had reservations for 3:00pm. The host was very rude and said we have to wait a few minutes at the bar because they were seating the big groups first who left deposits. Turns out a few minutes turned into 45 minutes which is absurd when we had reservations and we were a small group.\n\nAfter waiting the long 45minutes we were finally seated and at the worst area of the restaurant. We were facing a wall and next to the bathroom which was very uncomfortable when the line got long with all of the people passing by and bumping into us. Below I attached photos of when we were waiting at the bar and where we were seated.\n\nThe atmosphere here is fun but they need better staffing and organization!"

Before making the trip, we confirmed multiple times with the host that the full menu would be available.

No one in our party drinks, and the brunch menu didn’t offer the items we came for—so we decided to leave without ordering anything.\n\nWe were also asked to Zelle $10 per person just to reserve a table since our group had more than 5 people, which already felt sketchy. But we took the risk because we were excited about the food.\n\nCustomer service was terrible throughout the experience. The manager was just as unprofessional as the staff, which made sense in hindsight. After we left, the owner called and promised that we’d receive a refund first thing the next morning—but now it’s well past noon, and still nothing. They even blocked my number.\n\nThe whole experience was incredibly disappointing, unprofessional, and frankly, a waste of time and money."

I asked if we can be seated in the middle or upstairs & they gave us the meanest attitude, they explained all the other tables are reserved. They insinuated that if I wanted to be seated elsewhere I would have to pay extra… When I’ve already paid for my reservation two weeks prior. Again the place was empty, it was early and the other reservations were three hours later.. My family & I was trying to reason with them & when we spoke with the manager, she was dismissive. I’ve been to higher class restaurants with reservations & they freely allow you to switch where you would like to be seated without the nonsense.\n\nThey didn’t give me my refund for the reservation, even though it wasn’t stated that it was non-refundable. Another overhyped hoochie restaurant. The staff was miserable and tried to ruin a great day."

Depending on the day of the week or a holiday it can get super busy. Sip on your cocktail enjoy the music, and the food is worth waiting for."

Got the appetizer platter(the wings were a little over done not much meat on them, and the chicken croquettes were a little dry but everything else was good! And the octopus appetizer was really good. We got a few other dishes that were good and the Webster cocktail was good (:! Had some guy singing who was really good also! .. we went in on a random night and it wasn’t busy so not sure how it is when it’s busy on the weekends, but overall we enjoyed our date night <3"
