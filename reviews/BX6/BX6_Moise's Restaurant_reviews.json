Was more concern with drink offers and talking about deal for Fordham students which we are not. Ordered Caprise salad (missing balsamic) and grilled  watermelon salads (very little watermelon) nothing really impressive. Table bread was actually pita. Had chicken alfredo and the lasagna both plates close to $30 simple plates. No pictures because they really weren’t that impressive, just overpriced mediocre food. Had a child in the party and the pizza $19 was not ate by her bc it wasn’t child friendly or any good. Doesn’t look like the picture of previous pizza from this place."

Ordered the Clams Oregonata for appetizer and chicken franchaise and it came with spaghetti, but I wanted marinara sauce instead of the franchaise sauce on my spaghetti.  The owner, Moises, immediately scolded me saying NO, that I must have it with the franchaise sauce to which I answered UH, NO SIR, I want the marinara Sauce.  He then shook our hands and stormed off to the kitchen. The clams came out and immediately, I knew, these were frozen, and they were burned. The clam was old, the butter oil was old, the breading was old, really disgusting. Then the other young man named Angel came to us, and apologized profusely, asked if I wanted another appetizer to which I declined. The chicken had ZERO flavor, and the marinara sauce was simply tomatoe sauce. We asked for the check, and they just went back to the table they were sitting at to continue discussing menu options for another establishment!  Once again we asked for the check, to which again, he\nClaps his hands together and jumps up, really bizarre. STAY AWAY!"

I visited on a slow night, so it was quieter than usual, but the ambiance was still inviting and warm. The wine selection was spot-on, with choices that suited my taste perfectly.\n\nThe owner really made the night special – he was incredibly friendly and attentive, which gave the place a homey feel. Even though it was quiet when I arrived, I could tell his energy would remain the same even on busier nights. Since it was a slower evening, he was generous enough to offer us something on the house, which was a lovely and unexpected gesture.\n\nThis was my first time visiting, even though I live in the area, and it definitely didn’t disappoint. I can’t wait to return, especially to enjoy the patio when the weather’s nice. It’s definitely a spot worth checking out, and I’m already looking forward to my next visit! English and Spanish is welcome! Also love their wine selection!"

I ended up ordering chicken parm dinners for everyone.  I asked for garlic rolls and was told that they dont make garlic rolls. The dinners arrived and I thought it was a joke.  The chicken was more fit for a sandwich.  The portion of the pasta was so small.  I thought we ordered from the kids menu!! The sauce tasted like water down ketchup.  We asked three times for garlic powder.  The waiter finally returned with some kind of melted garlic butter and then charged me for a side dish.  I made him take it off the check. I walked by the kitchen and saw the cook using his bare hands to pick up cooked pasta from the prep area and put it into a container. So this is a so called Italian restaurant that does not make real pizzas, has no garlic rolls, plays spanish music and has to bribe people to leave a good Google review to receive a 5% discount.  Please do not waste your time or money on this DINER.  This is no italian restaurant and should not be in operation in the little italy area. The photos online looked NOTHING like the food I received!!!!!"

The place was almost empty (another blatant red flag) we saw the menus and noticed that many classic Italian staples were missing from the menu such as full sized pizzas, garlic bread, and cannolis. The water was room temperature tap water and when asked for ice it had sludge in it. We ordered chicken Parmesans and when the food finally came out the portion size was for a kid, the cheese was microwaved and the sauce tasted like ketchup. This was by far my worst restaurant experience ever and a total waste of time and money. Please go literally anywhere else."
