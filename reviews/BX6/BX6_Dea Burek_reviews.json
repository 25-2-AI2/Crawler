I can never really find pita and burek with cabbage , leek, or pumpkin, but Dea has all of them.\n\nPerfectly crispy, flaky, not greasy, full of ingredients, and made with love, this food brings me back to my grandmother’s cooking from my childhood.\n\nDea Burek is always an essential stop when I’m in the Bronx. 🇦🇱🇽🇰"

After she told us (in a very arrogant way) that the only choice is sliced burek, we placed the order. Two with cheese and yogurt. After we waited about half an hour (on a Tuesday 3pm  half empty place) we went to check on our order. It was behind the counter, but she didn’t serve it to us for some reason. Also she said that they are out of trays so burek was given on a paper plate.\nNot going back and not recommending this place to anyone."

We also brought home some cheese burek, and it was a huge hit with the family. Easily one of the best bureks I’ve had in New York."

Would love to get more if I lived closer, but it was a stop driving near the Bronx and well worth it.\nI thank the business for providing a quality product."

For family that knows and been all around Balkan countrys Dea Burek is not the place. Sorry but maybe less grease and more real meet would work better."
