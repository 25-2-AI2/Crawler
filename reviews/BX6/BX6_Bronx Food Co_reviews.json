There needs to be organization and structure so incidents like this are prevented in the future. my order number is #y89ba placed at 5:57pm and it's now 7:02....not to mention my order was marked ready almost immediately after I placed it, maybe to keep order times low but not cool, and by the way the ONLY available option is pick up, so I dont understand the reply from owner, kinda sounds automated like they dont really care.
