I tried the Tuna fish sandwich - it's small in portion size and ok in taste- not the best.

I ordered the Famous No Fork Special; it’s the one with beef, house sauce and oregano (pardon me if I missed an ingredient). The order cost about $14 after tax. Unfortunately, I was rather disappointed by the price and food quality.\n\nThey offered a substantial amount of food that centralizes in carbohydrates - great for sharing. The sandwich was approximately one foot long with a skimpy layer of beef and a whole lot of sauce, along with a size of French fries. (Surprisingly the French fries are incredibly crunchy for a take out order.) The sauce is delightful to have, and usually a little extra doesn’t hurt cause who doesn’t love sauce? For this particular sandwich, I wasn’t able to taste the meat. With the meat shredded and minced, all I could taste was the house-made sauce and seasoning on bread.\n\nI encourage everyone who loves carbs to try this place for yourself. I personally wouldn’t recommend this restaurant to any of my friends or family."

We even got a sausage samuna which is amazing with the chipotle mayo they recommended with it.

You will only find it in your sandwich, and eventually in your tummy.\n- The fries are on point and they transform into masterful treats once dipped in the homemade No Fork Chipotle Mayo.\n- Now! The pepperoncini peppers, and the Kalamata olives are locally sourced and they are basically sides, but alternating between the two as you progress through the sandwich will open you up to a new world of flavors and delight.\n\nBottom line/ Tldr;\nThis is NOT your Bodega/deli sandwich.\nThis sandwich is a work of art in the form of what appears to be a very simple sandwich.\nThe No Fork sauce is something that will leave you contemplating ordering a second sandwich.\nIt's hard to explain... The price is not based on what you see. It's based on the experience you go through with every bite you take.\n\nJust try it out.\nIt's not just a sandwich.\nYou'll find out soon enough."

What really did it for me was the BREAD!! It’s so fresh and the perfect balance of soft and toasted — I also had the calzone kinda concoction with sesame and I’d have to say that was my favorite.
