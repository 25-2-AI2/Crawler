We waited about 15 to 20 minutes before we went back to him to ask about the song. In return, his response was “I dont have a reason to not play your song, sorry.” and in disbelief and shock we returned to our night out. It was just a bummer that one song couldnt be played due to another group of people having a certain music taste. 👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾 The dj of the night was named andreas, cool  guy but his decision was kinda unfair. :/"

The waiter remembered us and welcomed us back. We got seated, they brought out two waters and menus. That was the last time we talked to anyone there. Over twenty minutes of waiting, and no one came to even take drink orders, much less food. Two tables that arrived after us had their drinks already, and we had yet to place a drink order. One of them even had their appetizers. Finally we got up and left, and even then the wait staff paid no attention as we walked away. I will not be returning there ever again. Clearly my earlier tip was not money well spent."
