I had mine with garlic naan bread but I was confused because when I got home I saw there was no rice but I paid extra for naan. So you get a choice of either naan or rice and if you want naan you pay extra but no rice. It was delicious and I would recommend 💯 it is a small joint but they know how to cook. The atmosphere, I wish they had a/c but it wasn't hot or crazy.\n\nEdit: I had their butter chicken but it wasn't as good as their Tikka masala, the butter chicken is more tangy and it tasted like it has lemon or a bit sour. The chicken didn't look like it was fresh or that it was cooked in the sauce. It didn't seem part of the sauce like the Tikka masala I had days ago. I'm staying away from it. My next dish is their biryani either chicken or shrimp. I'll keep you guys posted."

It’s a hole in the wall spot that shares its space with multiple different businesses and doesn’t have a strong online presence but this place is such a hidden gem. If you like Indian food you’ll love this place everything is made in-house from scratch and you can taste the difference. Family owned business with passionate staff. Best Indian food I’ve had in the Bronx hands down."
