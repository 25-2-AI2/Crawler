That said, I hope this review gives them a chance to improve.\nThis was my first time ordering the boneless chicken with fries, and unfortunately, it was a big letdown. The chicken was undercooked, and the sauce had no flavor, it honestly tasted off like a chemical. I also tried their Dubai chocolate, and it was one of the worst I’ve had. On a positive note, their Salaam Coke was actually really good, it was my first time trying it. Also, the person at the register was very friendly and polite. Overall, the food was a huge disappointment, especially for the price I paid. Maybe I’ll give them another chance sometime in the future, but for now, I can’t recommend it based on this experience."

The young lady at the counter was impatient and sucked her teeth as someone who was indecisive about their order because it’s their first time ordering food from there.  The wings came out and was NOT GOOD AT ALL…. Wish they had zero stars available.. Until they changed the menu and their service is better I will not be going there. And response you provided was not true.  I spoke with the cashier and told her she should be more patient and give me a chance to decide she only spoke to the guys behind the counter and you all just looked at me, with no apology.. and I did not eat all of the wings.  What happened to good customer service…\nSo your response is an example of the poor service you provide…no acknowledgment of your wrong doing.👎🏾"

            "text": "First time ordering and definitely the last. I ordered two wing combos with cheese fries, and everything was just awful. The garlic parmesan wings had no flavor at all, the chicken was tough, hard to chew, and had a weird soapy taste — like it was washed in dish soap. Completely inedible.\n\nThe fries were soggy, and the cheese had a sour taste like it had gone bad. Absolutely disgusting. My daughter got the mild wings, took one bite, and couldn’t eat the rest. She said they tasted weird too — and she’s not picky.\n\nI was expecting good wings and decent food, but this was a total letdown. For what I paid, this was unacceptable. Never ordering from here again"
