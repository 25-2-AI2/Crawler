It can get very loud here so if you want to have a conversation without having your lips next to the person's ear then this place is not for you. Also they are a bit on the expensive side and they add an 18% tip to the total so the check can climb very quickly. I love this restaurant. I've been coming here for years and they stand on top of the heap as far as local restaurants are concerned. You can also enjoy live performances, hookahs (if you're into that) and a variety of Spanish contemporary music plus oldie throwbacks. Eugenio is superb behind the bar. Highly recommended!"

They make you feel welcome and give you a very good service. I personally like that when my friends and I got there on April 20th to have a small celebration of their wedding, the restaurant was closed but they opened it ahead of their schedule and started given us a great service. I would have given them a 5 star but I'm not sure if the manager or owner was not happy that we were having a good time without bothering the other clientele. I think they need to be more down to earth in order in order to get the 5 star that other owners have gitten when I have visited their restaurants. My best wishes to the people that works there, they are the ones that make this place a great place to have a good time."
