One order now is technically a lunch, $25 for boneless chicken chunks, and the rice and beans come in a lunch container. Cold and not-so-good food. They either changed the owner or something happened with the chefs. TERRIBLE DELIVERY, PORTIONS AND QUALITY. Only good thing is the lady that answers the phone."

I had JUST walked in it was crowded and then she asked me (in the tiny space where you can see everyone walk in) “Did you place an order yet?” With the nastiest attitude. She made me feel like I shouldn’t be there. I came in with my fair skinned Dominican friend who pointed out that I got treated that way because I was darker. She also mentioned that the worker was nicer to her when she ordered. It’s 2025. Why are we treating people like this? I came in there to spend money in YOUR establishment, and that’s how you treat me? As a black woman? I serve YOUR community, and that’s how you treat me? I don’t even want to food anymore. I would have disputed the charge, but I’m a woman of God, and I rather WARN other black people instead. Y’all can have the money, I pray you consider how you treat people. Do better."

            "text": "I recently visited this restaurant and was genuinely impressed by its warm and welcoming atmosphere. The interior design is tasteful and cozy, making it a great spot for both casual dinners and special occasions. The lighting is just right, the music sets the mood without being too loud, and the staff is attentive and friendly without being overbearing.\n\nThe food? Delicious. Everything was fresh and beautifully plated, and the menu offers a good mix of creative and classic options. I especially appreciated how clean and organized everything felt — it really added to the overall experience.\n\nThat said, there was one downside that took away from an otherwise perfect visit: the smell of cigar smoke near the entrance. While the restaurant itself is non-smoking (which I love), some patrons were standing right outside the door smoking cigars, and the scent definitely drifted in. It’s a bit frustrating, especially if you’re sensitive to smoke or just don’t want that lingering smell before a meal.\n\nIt wouldn’t stop me from coming back, but I do hope the management can find a way to gently encourage smokers to move a bit further from the entrance. A small change that could make a big difference in an otherwise excellent dining experience."

            "text": "Update: Someone from this location sent a message regarding my review indicating that they only charge gratuity to groups. This is something I'm aware of since the 80s, but a group is 8+ of people. I couldn't respond to the message, so I'll respond here. It was only 4 of us, my son, his girlfriend, a friend, and myself. If this is considered a group, then signs should be put up so customers are aware that even when receiving bad service, they're forced to leave a tip.\n=============================\nThe reason I will not visit again is because they automatically charge you the gratuity, and the waitress did not deserve it. She took our order, brought it to the table, and never came back. Tips are not an obligation to give, and the business should not be allowed to charge it. Tips shouldn't be put on my check automatically. Bad service is not rewarded. Restaurants that do this I do not return too and I never recommend it. Restaurants like this should never be visited or given any business at all."

And i ordered mofongo de queso. It came out dry and not so good taste. The others ordered steak, and 2 of them came out good, but one of them came out raw undercooked. When cooking it again, it came out raw again, but there was a piece that was cooked, and it was supposed to be well done. Tostones is good. i recommended getting it, and fries are good also.\n\n!! > AND BECAREFUL they automatically added tips in your check. They just put 15 percent tip of our check.
