Two regular size slices of bread filled with generous sized amount of roast beef. The taste of the beef was very very good I will say. What got me was the price. I don’t think it was $30 worth of flavor."

            "text": "It was a Sunday, October 12th,2025 my husband and I (both in our 70's)was on our way home from Church Service decided we wanted pastrami sandwiches. My daughter had order from Libmen's for herself and her 92yr old grandmother, they both enjoyed the sandwiches, so we drove uptown to Liebman's. We ordered 3 pastrami sandwiches on a roll and Cole slaw with my Latino brother behind the counter.We spend about $92 with taxes and fees for using a credit card. We received our order drop off my daughter's sandwich could not wait to get home and eat ours. We were never so upset and disappointed.  These sandwiches was made with scrapes (fall away meat after you've sliced a slice,shavings). I checked with my daughter and her's was the same. We didn't want to go back to the restaurant and make a scene, return the sandwiches and demand our money back. We would have been well within our rights but instead we made 2 half sandwiches with the 2 whole sandwiches.  The rest of it went to the garbage. Total DISRESPECT!!!!\nI called the next day to speak to the manager.  The lady who answered the phone told me to hold on when she came back told me that he was busy took my name and phone# told me he would 📞 me, until now I am still waiting.🤨 We come to your establishment in good faith to spend our money with our Jewish Brothers and get a good product not your garage you want to get rid of. Everyone who come to your establishment should be respected.We were DISRESPECTED in your Deli because they felt comfortable treating us that way but stuff like that comes from the top. So I say to Liebman's 💰 is hard to come by and if you want to continue in business you must treat EVERYONE the same. I WILL NOT RETURN TO Liebman's to be DISRESPECTED AGAIN.I WILL TELL OTHERS I KNOW ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE. People of a different or darker hue BEWARE U MAY NOT BE TREATED THE SAME. Had I ordered on line would my sandwiches be better because then you would not know that I was a Black Women.🤔🤨😡"

The matzah ball soup with noodles and bits of fresh chicken is to die for! Flavorful and lasting taste soup. The pastrami taste and texture is what I call A1 triple stars. Exactly how I've always liked my pastrami!  The knish was okay it was good on the inside but tough on the outside. I also wished it was warmer and perhaps, fresher. Almost forgot, coleslaw and pickles were awesome too! This was on a Sunday and it got a bit crowded but not too bad about 12:15pm. Before then it was quite quiet and chill. Service is OUTSTANDING!"

            "text": "Walked in right when it opened on a Tuesday morning at 11am. I was the first to sit down for table service and was quickly greeted by Jodi.\n\nShe was very sweet and I told her that I was on a mission to try the Pastrami Rueben so she put in my order along with a Dr. Brown’s Root beer soda right away.\n\nMy order came with coleslaw and two halves of deli pickles\n\nThe wait wasn’t long. It was about 10 minutes from when I sat down that Jodi was on her way bringing my pastrami. She very kind to hand me my root beer beforehand.\n\nBetween two slices of toasted rye, with a nice layer of Russian dressing sauerkraut, stood this mini-mound of delicious looking pastrami. It smelled great because it seemed like when they cut the sandwich in half, I think they press that side onto the flat top making that edge nice and crispy but not disturbing the rest of the soft meat that’s in the sandwich.\n\nIt was great, the pastrami wasn’t too hot, nice and warm. The creaminess from the Russian dressing along with the sauerkraut compliments the pastrami very well. The rye although lightly toasted, doesn’t stay very crunchy because the heat from within the sandwhich itself softens it up, yet the bread didn’t get soggy.\n\nThe slaw and the pickles add the extra crunchiness that you may be looking for incase the sauerkraut doesn’t suffice. Is it necessary? Maybe some people may find it to be too much food, but for me, you can’t go wrong with slaw and pickles when you’re eating a great pastrami sandwich.\n\nThe atmosphere was great, feels like an old-school diner from when I was growing up. From what I saw, there were a number of original art pieces hung throughout the dining room. And it seems as if they were all from different artists.. I’d like to look into them next time I visit.\n\nThe lighting is nice. Soft white lights.. compliments the art pieces and it lights up everything nicely. Allows for a nice sit down alone or amongst family and friends.\n\nOverall, I can’t wait to go back. Next time I’d like to bring my family. There is something for everyone on the menu. I’m glad they have a kids menu (for the picky eaters) and they also had a selection of desserts. I shared my pictures in the menu section but I will also share them here.\n\n$ Price-wise…\nPastrami and similar meats are not cheap.\nAm I okay with what I paid? Yes. The food was delicious, the service was great, and the timing was outstanding. I’d like to revisit during a lunch or possibly a dinner rush. I don’t think food quality will be affected but I’m intrigued to see how long my wait time will be. Am I worried, not at all, just as long as the food is good.. and so far they’re batting 1000%.\n\nThank you Liebman’s, can’t wait to go back."

            "text": "Today, April 22, 2023, I took a three hour schlep from South Brooklyn to Riverdale up in da Bronx to Liebman's Kosher Delicatessen & Restaurant at 552 W 235th St, Bronx, NY 10463. Now I have a soft spot for this place, because my aunt Joan and Uncle Bill z\"l lived a couple of blocks away and had Liebman's cater all their simchas. Sadly, they've been gone for over 15 years, so it's been a while.\nI arrived at Liebman's around noon, having left home around 9am and I was hungry. The first thing I noticed is that the place had had a facelift and that it was a lot brighter and cheerful than it had been in the past. Being the last day for the Riverdale Restaurant Week Special, I went for it, ordering a Pastrami on rye, full sour pickles, a square knish and a Dr. Brown's Cel-Ray from my friendly and attentive waiter for the unbelievable price of only $20. By the time I got back from the sparkling clean rest room, everything was laid out at my table and I was ready to feast!\nThe generous standard (as opposed to the overstuffed which would have been $5 extra and worth every penny) 12 oz. of pastrami was machine sliced, but thicker than Sarge's and Pastrami Queen. It was glistening with fat, had a nice crust of spices and a noticeable smoke ring. It was beautifully tender and juicy, nicely smoky and had just the perfect amount of salt. It was the best Kosher pastrami I've had in NYC, and I'd rank it just under Katz's pastrami for flavor and tenderness; definitely worth the trip.\nThe Cole slaw was shaved thin, but retained it's crispiness. It was some of the freshest and tastiest I've had in a while. The pickles, while being juicy and garlicky, were nice and crispy, not mushy like pickles in a lot of places. They made a wonderful palate cleanser in-between bites of sandwich and sips of Cel-Ray.\nWhen, not if, I return, I'm going to try the overstuffed version, which at $26.99 is still a bargain for an overstuffed Kosher pastrami sandwich.\nIn my humble opinion, Liebman's Kosher Delicatessen & Restaurant is worth the trip!"

Their sides are to die for as well, the potato salad was so masterfully seasoned.\n\nAnd onto their deli sandwich, stacked so high with nicely sliced pieces of pastrami! And they gave some delicious homemade mustard too. Great service, friendly staff, and felt very much like eating at home. Such a comfortable and inviting environment.
