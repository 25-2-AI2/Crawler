When I got home and took a bite, the chicken tasted slimy. Upon checking, I saw the meat was pink and clearly undercooked. I inspected the rest of the sandwiches and found that one more was also raw, while the others appeared to be cooked.\n\nI immediately called the store and spoke with a manager, who asked me to bring the food back. When I returned, I requested a refund but was told I could not get my money back. The manager offered no explanation or apology, just a suggestion to remake the sandwiches, which I declined. When I mentioned I would be contacting the Department of Health, the manager responded with a slick comment and even provided the phone number.\n\nIt was also concerning to see very young employees in the kitchen who seemed improperly trained, likely a factor in this serious food safety issue. I did contact the health department, but all they did was ask for details and said they would follow up with the location.\n\nThis location used to be great, but now it has completely fallen off. Serving raw chicken is unacceptable and dangerous. Stay away."

This way I can load up on some carbs to fuel my shopping at BJ'S which is exactly what I did during this visit. When I walked in the place was virtually empty with way more staff than customers....three customers in total. The place is so beautiful I was not able to comprehend why it was empty. The girl at the register was helpful and has a great sense of humor. I ended up getting the BBQ Bacon Cheddar Black Bean Burger with sweet potatoes fries and chipotle sauce. My stomach cannot handle regular milk or spicy food so I had to ask if it was just a hint for flavor or habanero level spicy. The entire place was very clean, great place for someone with OCD, everything was neatly and nicely organized. They have table service my food was brought out on a nice metal tray/rack. Everything tasted great. As I was about to leave...5pm WHOA! It's like a whole swarm of customers with children descended on this location...the line was to the exit door the entire time after 5pm then I realized kids get a free meal after 5pm with purchase of an adult meal! SCORE....for parents...and their beneficiaries! I highly recommend, especially if you have a kid, or two, or three. I will definitely grab a bite here every weekend I go to BJ'S."

I could have gotten something more tasty and cheaper at a deli. I’m also not entirely certain the cheese was cheddar. Seemed more like American.\n\nThe chicken sandwich was worse. I had hoped it would be a nice fried chicken breast but it was basically thin, overcooked chicken strips. The best part was the pickles.\n\nThe fries were ok, but bland and overpriced for what you get.\n\nUpdate: now that I have looked a photos of other people's smashburger, what I purchased doesn't even look the same. My bun was a sesame seed bun (not potato),  the fries were not the same and even the wrapping was different. So I'm not sure if I got conned by some knock-off smashburger truck or something.\n\nWould I try smashburger again: no."
