One time I was told that they don't want to heat it at all since it will get cold again when I get home and I will lose the oils If I needed to reheat it.  I explained that is no problem, I like it heated in the special pizza oven. Usually, when I order pizza I need to wait about 5 minutes but I can't understand why they are skimping on the oven now. They said their oven is much hotter so it will burn. Since it is a pizza store, shouldn't the oven be kept at the proper temperature for heating pizza? I don't understand why they would treat their customers this way.  It's a shame because since I don't drive, this is the store that I would need to patronize."

            "text": "I’m not quite sure what to make of this place. On a good day I would probably give it three stars. There is nothing exceptional about it, either pro or con. It’s a kosher dairy restaurant and bakery, the food is fair, the ambience is acceptable and the service is decent. However, on my most recent visit there, it wasn’t a good day. While perusing the menu, I was excited to see the “Impossible Burger” as one of the choices. Wow! The “Impossible Burger” is very popular right now and sometimes it’s harder to find than a Willy Wonka chocolate bar with the “Golden Ticket,” especially in a kosher restaurant. And yet, here it was! I happily ordered it but became immediately suspicious when the waiter brought it over. I had to literally search for the patty. As in hide and seek. Any of you who have had a real “Impossible Burger,” as I have, know that the patty is HUGE. And it really does taste like meat. It’s delightfully perverse in a way. This burger’s patty was minuscule and my guess is that it was a generic vegetarian patty. And it certainly didn’t taste like the real thing because it clearly wasn’t. I turned to the waiter laughing and asked, “Are you sure this is the ‘Impossible Burger?’” He replied (somewhat hesitantly) in the affirmative. I asked another waiter to check with the owner. The owner couldn’t be found (it’s not a very big restaurant). Perhaps the owner thought that “Impossible Burger” is to veggie patty what “Kleenex” is to tissue: a genericized trademark. All I know is I paid close to twenty dollars for a generic veggie burger. Impossible, you say? Very possible. And unfortunate."

I started going to this place about a year ago maybe 3 to 4 times, I would always get their desserts  but the last two times I went I was really hooked on the Mediterranean Salad, which is ok am a caregiver for twins and  vegetarian and find it sometimes difficult to find food that has no meat or on the go. My last visit to this place was horrific, I went there  with my twins, while I was standing waiting on my order to be done on a side because the place is really narrow. I was told by an senior lady who work at the counter to GET OUT. I was shocked to hear this and I didn't know or couldn't understand what just happened.  Mind  you my kids are in a stroller. Why was I  told to get out-- can you guess?  Because the color of my (Brown)skin?  She told me again to get  out that I was in the way; but I wasn't--I was on a side. A Latin gentleman who work behind the counter came to my defense and asked  her how could I leave when I'm waiting  for  food? At the end the gentleman apologize for her rude behavior.They were others customers in the same area with whom she had no problem. I refrained from responding rudely  to this old lady but this experience caught me by surprise and left me feeling sad."
