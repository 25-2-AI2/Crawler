The staff is very sweet, and the place clean. The food is on the pricier side compared to the area, but it does justice to the quality. Highly recommended!"

The first time I visited over a year ago, I ordered a vegan sandwich and was surprised at the higher total at checkout. When I questioned it, a thin Hispanic guy behind the counter told me not to go by the menu prices because “they aren’t correct.”\n\nDespite this, I gave them another chance—mostly because healthy food options in the area are limited. I ordered an açaí bowl three days in a row, and each day I was charged a different price. I was supposed to be paying $14, but the price kept creeping up until today, when I was told it was $20. At that point, I had enough and walked away.\n\nIt’s disappointing and honestly feels like they’re making up prices on the spot. I won’t be returning."

These cookies will melt in your mouth and are absolutely delicious for a healthy treat!!! So glad they are next door to my Dermatologist, I will surely be coming back!"
