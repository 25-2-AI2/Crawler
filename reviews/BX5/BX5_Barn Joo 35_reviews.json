The place is small but cozy — it feels welcoming and not overcrowded, which I really liked.\n\nThe menu has a good amount of options — enough to choose from without feeling overwhelming. We started with the chicken bites, which were super good: crispy, came out hot, and had a nice spicy sauce. For the mains, we had beef bibimbap and bulgogi — both were delicious and really hit the spot. I also tried one of their drinks, which was tasty and a bit unique.\n\nThey do have a happy hour, but it ends early (around 5 p.m.), so we missed it. Prices are pretty typical for Manhattan: appetizers around $15-$20, mains around $24-$30, and drinks about $20.\n\nThe vibe is relaxed and pleasant, the service was friendly and quick, and everything we ordered tasted great.\n\nOverall, I’d give Barn Joe 35 a solid 5/5 — cozy spot with good food, good service, and a nice atmosphere. Would definitely recommend!"

It’s a great little place with wonderful food that is perfect for hanging out after work or a casually meeting with friends.\n\nIf you make a reservation you get to spin a little wheel for a prize. We won free soju shots which was nice. We ordered a bunch of apps to share which I feel is the way to go here. We had the fried veggie dumplings, bulgogi tacos, shrimp tempura roll, soy garlic wings, and popcorn chicken. Everything was very tasty. If I had to nit pick i’d say the bulgogi tacos could have been better. They tasted like regular beef tacos and should have had more of a bulgogi flavor profile.\nBut the fried foods were hot a crispy, the sushi was fresh, and the portions were a great size.\n\nThe restaurant was quite busy on a random Wednesday evening in the summer so I’d recommend getting a reservation to be safe, however it seemed many people were walk ins."

I would come back just for this. It’s only $28 as well. I don’t know what they added inside but it had crunch but I loved it. The galbi jjim was so good. Another mention is the soju cocktail flight, if you wanted to try all the signature cocktails, there you go! I loooved the cucumber cooler. One of my favs. They have plenty of space upstairs and downstairs. Our server Janice was super sweet as well! Would 100% come back."

I liked it but didn’t like it that much for foods and drinks.\n\nFrom tofu & kimchi menu, tofu was very nice cause it had perfect crispness and amazing spicy flavor. However, due to its spicy sauce on it, it can’t go together with kimchi cause spicy + spicy just doesn’t make sense. So it was confusing as a menu. Typical Korean way of tofu & kimchi menu is served with tofu in its original white and soft form.\n\nCocktails were bit off to my palate. They were generally all too sweat.\n\n한번 저녁식사 해보기로는 무난하게 괜찮은 곳이었지만 굳이 다시 가고싶다는 생각까지는 안들꺼 같아요.\n\n두부김치의 경우 두부가 살짝 튀긴채로 매콤한 강정소스 같은걸 묻혀나와서 정말 맛있기는 했는데 흔히 한국인이 생각하는 \"두부김치\"의 조합이 아니라 좀 뇌에 렉 걸리는 느낌이었습니다. 애초에 매운소스에 김치까지 얹는건 메뉴로써는 부조화 같은…? 김치는 아예 빼버리고 두부만 주인공으로 하는게 더 맥락이 맞을꺼 같아요.\n\n술은 그냥 그랬어요. 소주칵테일을 비롯한 칵테일들이 전반적으로 너무 달아요."

Though the place is called Barn Joo, I didn’t try their alcohol. Their uni bowl is a standout — $26 for that much uni in NYC is a rare find, and the combination of ingredients in the bowl is flavorful and balanced. The interior shows a bit of age but is cozy and atmospheric, with a bar that’s well-stocked and a kitchen in clear view. Service is quick and attentive, from order to water refills. Walk-in seating is usually manageable, which makes it an even easier recommendation."

We both thought that the seafood pancake and budaejjigae were okay. The seafood pancake was very bready, and didn't have much seafood in it, so we were a bit disappointed.

My friends were running a little late, but they accommodated and let me sit at the table to wait for them. I like the upstairs area. It’s very roomy. The food is good and came on time! The drinks are really good too. We got the Soju cocktail flights and it was good!"

Highly recommend for anyone looking to try unique Korean cuisine!"

Yay!  The portions are huge. I had the ssam galbi and it came with lettuce cup soup, side dish, rice, and Galbi of course.  I couldn’t finish it so I had to take half home. We all had different things so it was nice to taste. I’ll definitely come back! I’m\nHungry just looking at the photos! Service was friendly & courteous."

We had a party of 6 at 8pm on a Saturday and didn’t have reservations but the staff got a table together for us in the blink of an eye. The restaurant is quaint and has a lovely atmosphere. The rear open kitchen concept allows you to see what’s happening or focus on your own party. The food was outstanding. And the kitchen prepares and brings everything out family style. But everyone had food within 5 minutes of the first dish being dropped off. Perfect levels of spice and heat. I highly recommend the seafood Japche as an entrée and the shishito peppers and mushrooms as an appetizer. Samantha was an amazing server, but the entire staff was so friendly and helpful. 10/10 will be returning."

We also got the tacos and they were ok as well. I liked the lil salsa that came along with it. It was a bit of a chilly night so we got the Korean army stew as our main dish and it was super filling with tofu, sausage, and noodles. The truffle fries were also delicious! I would go back for the fries alone! Overall, it was good but would probably skip the seafood pancake and the tacos and try other items next time!"

We had to wait a bit, but just grabbed drinks at the bar and ordered some apps. Perfect. We got somaek (beer and soju, if you don't know), seafood pancakes, wings, truffle fries, and dumplings. Honestly, the wings were the absolute winner. Like, those soy garlic wings? Crispy as anything, and just...delicious. The pancake was packed with stuff, and those crispy edges? So good. Fries and dumplings were solid, no complaints. And man, the staff was on it. It was crazy busy, but they kept everything running smooth. You know how it is on a weekend. Seriously, good vibes all around."

I've enjoyed the Korean tapas concept at Danji before and Barn Joo doesn't disappoint either!\n\nWe had the Seafood Pancake, Steamed Veggie dumpling, and Barn Joo Salad and greatly enjoyed all of them a lot. The lemonade with its glowing light in the glass was a nice touch. The ambience is excellent and the service was amazing. Overall, highly recommend!"

The dumplings were good, truffle fries average. Main course- veggie japche - exceptional! Loved every spoon of it; tofu and mushroom hot stone bowl- yummy, just loved the way tofu was cooked, melted in the mouth! Overall, great service, good food!"
