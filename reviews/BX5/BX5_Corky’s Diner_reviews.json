The eggs were cooked just how I like them, and the turkey bacon was nice and crispy! The staff were friendly and moved quickly. It is a small diner and you instantly feel like family when you dine there. Please make sure to visit them. You won’t regret it."

The other workers seems like they walk on eggshells due to the old man breathing down their necks ever so often. I wouldn’t recommend you eat here.

Service was excellent and they even came out and organized the seats for us to sit. This is a 5 star definitely."

It's a very  quaint diner; not large enough for large groups. The diner has counter seating for lone diners (those eating by themselves). Free refills on coffee. The lemonade made from scratch is awesome! There is a restroom and a mounted t.v. on which the last time I was there, either they were showing the news or sports (I really wasn't paying any attention to it). I would say that the majority of the employees there are very pleasant.  Yes, I would recommend this place to all!"

Immediately one of the owner tells the waitress to ask me to stand up from the booth because I was by myself. Then another waitress approaches me and says that if I was only ordering coffee and toast I could not stay at their establishment. I told them that I was starting with coffee and toast because I’m a slow eater but that I was going to order my meal as soon as I was ready. The owner kept sending back his employees to remind me that I must but a meal order in order for me to continue sitting at their establishment. This is not only ridiculous but beyond unbelievable. For one I could have gone to another establishment, instead I like to support my local neighborhood business. I’m embarrassed and ashamed that people like these own a business in my community."
