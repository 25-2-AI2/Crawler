            "text": "This was such a hidden gem that our family discovered during a trip to the Catskills area. About 20 minutes away from Kartrite, and absolutely worth the drive if you’re looking for authentic Korean food. It’s a small menu, but very special because the couple owns one of the only for eel fishing licenses in the state of NY.  I’ve had plenty of eel before prepared in sushi, but never had freshwater eel grilled like this!  I was so pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. Fresh, mild flavor, and the grilled texture was perfect with a little char.  My two young daughters also really liked it.  It was especially good eaten in a ssam wrap. All the kkaenip and banchan were vegetables from their garden, fresh and delicious. The other dish we ordered was the dakdoritang. When he brought it out, he had mentioned that the chicken meat may be a bit more tough than what we are used to because it’s from the chickens they have in the back!  It was indeed different than the GMO chicken we see often that’s plump full of whole knows what, but it definitely was more tasty. Nice and spicy, good contrast with the potatoes and carrots, and the stew was delicious over rice. Again, my girls loved the dish and asked for more rice to have with the soup.\n\nBut wait, there’s more that makes this place so memorable! They make their own makgeolli and sell in bottles with no preservatives.  It’s soooo much better than what you find commercially in grocery stores. It’s less sweet, no artificial sugary taste at all, more tart, and higher alcohol content. Since we had to drive back, we needed to walk off the unexpected buzz and the sweet owners graciously let us explore their property. We saw the chickens, eels, and walked to the river where the eels are caught.  It was a beautiful area, especially on a warm fall day, and the whole experience was truly one to be remembered.\n\nHighly recommend this place. It’s not big, so better for small groups. Worth traveling for though since you really can’t find a place that cooks fresh eel like this anywhere in NYC."

I finally found one, and tasted almost as same as my favorite place in Jeju. The chicken dish (we had the dakdoritang) was also very tasty as the meats were so tender and well absorbed by the seasoning. Furthermore, the chef’s banchan was just incredible. Very humble and not very special selections but very satisfying .. not overly seasoned and not salty yet you could almost taste Korea’s countryside. I would definitely bring my family and friends again. Love it!!!!"

It was not 4 whole chickens. They only cook half of the portion and fill the plate with liquid. Extremely disappointed. As you can see on the picture, they give no chicken. I really hope the owner reads this and change the way they operate. Please don't go with a group of people because they will rip you off that petty. If you are going to go,just order 1 portion because whether you order 1 or 4 portions, they will use the same amount of ingredient.\n\nAlso, they give such small portion of rice. We had to literally ask them to give rice 5 times and they bring so little. If they are going to be that stingy giving free refills of rice at a korean restaurant , just charge the rice then for them to feel better.\nShe keeps telling us to use the liquid leftover from\nthe chicken and mix with rice, but makes no sense since they are too cheap to give rice anyway.\nSo no meat and no rice period at this place.\n\nI won't be returning, they definitely are not what they used to be. I hope they give proper portions for the price they charge. Please reconsider coming with your significant others."

But it's a must try when you pass by the area, very unique style, not like an usual restaurant everywhere, we are here to enjoy. Food ingredients are fresh from their farm, directly cook by order so try to call in first if you dont want to wait. Natural is beautiful n the owners are kind."

The texture was so different from a typical sushi restaurant. It's worth noting that their eel is only available in fall since they can only catch it at the end of summer."

            "text": "Really enjoyed an amazing lunch this past weekend at NY Makgeolli.  The proprietors are a wonderful local couple that have been working hard to build their restaurant and finally have started with a soft opening.  The makgeolli won't be flowing until later this year and the menu is currently limited.  However, our meal was packed with flavor and impressive were the various kimchees/banchan they provided as a proper accompaniment to the meal.  Most, if not all, were made on site and came from their garden.\nThey have grilled, freshwater eel that was tasty but for me, the dakdoritang, a spicy braised chicken dish with potatoes was the star.  The succulent chicken in a spicy, savory and sweet sauce just perfectly balanced and although a copious portion, we succeeded in finishing as it was quite addictive.  I quickly got over the void of makgeolli as soju was a great accompaniment.  They offer beer and soft drinks also.\nWe walked around their property after the meal as it extends to the river and sat for a moment to soak in the nature.  A fun and memorable outing which we plan to do again soon.  Some tips are that the property is right off route 209, cash only at the moment and making a reservation may be helpful although not required."
