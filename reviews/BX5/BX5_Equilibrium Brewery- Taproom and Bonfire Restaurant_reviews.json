No issue finding a parking spot on a Thursday evening in their lot. We were greeted right away by Rosa who made us feel welcomed and had a seat at the bar. The beer was everything we expected it to be which was great of course as we’ve had some of their brews before. We got a light dinner of chicken tenders that came with fries and a side of potato salad. The food was priced well and enough for the two of us to split. You can tell Rosa is a staple at the brewery as many patrons knew her and had conversation. We grabbed some four packs and stickers to go and headed out but had a great overall experience and would definitely stop again next time we are heading through Middletown!"

            "text": "Our last visit to EQ was for Father’s Day 3 years ago, though we’ve been fans for years, since the original location opened and my husband has picked up beer many times since. Sadly yesterday’s visit for Father's Day fell short of our expectations for a few reasons, mostly due to them being understaffed and having 3 amazing bartenders serving the entire bar, restaurant, and outdoor area. I made a reservation online for 3 people at 12:30 and we arrived and were seated by one of the bartenders, who gave us menus and told us to order at the bar. That seemed odd, since 3 of us were getting food, but it quickly became clear that there was no traditional waitstaff (last time we came for Father’s Day, we ordered directly from the table using QR codes, which was totally fine so we could order more as we wanted and then check out online). We had to remember orders for 3 people and wait at the bar to order, which took time, and by 12:45, they were out of the advertised bone-in beef rib, which my husband wanted. Not sure how they sold out of a special so quickly. We got our drinks and settled down then proceeded to wait 45 minutes (yes, 45) for 2 brisket sandwiches, a ½ lb of brisket, pretzels, and skillet mac n cheese. The fries that came with the sandwiches were not even lukewarm, so I assume they had been sitting until one of the bartenders could grab them to bring to our table. Someone else brought the skillet of mac n cheese shortly after and warned us that it was “hot” to which I replied “at least something is hot” because our meals weren’t (she laughed, no offer of further assistance). Getting a 2nd round of drinks took about 10 minutes as well and at that point, we wanted to settle up and leave after. I will say that the food was very good and the brisket was flavorful but waiting 45 minutes for cold food negated it. Waiting to pay to get out also took another good 10 minutes or so. Then my husband wanted to stop at the retail shop to get a few bottles on the way out. Had to wait there as well for one of the bartenders to come over to assist. I asked him if it’s normally this short handed and he sighed and said they didn’t realize it would be so busy on Father’s Day. The bartenders did a great job but 3 people cannot manage to serve an entire bar and restaurant. Other patrons looked annoyed as well as people were piled around the bar waiting to order and when we left around 2:30, a table who arrived shortly after us still had not gotten their food. Though the food was good, it was not worth the wait time to stand at the bar and have to wait and order food and drinks. We could have had a much better experience elsewhere. I don’t know who thought that was an adequate amount of staff to have at a brewery, especially on Father’s Day, but we will not be back and will stick to beer pickup or shipping in the future."

We stopped in for dinner and drinks, and I can't say enough about the amazing food. We tried the burger and the BBQ, both of which were absolutely delicious. The flavors were bold and fresh, and the presentation was top-notch.\n\nThe standout for us was definitely the beer. The selection was impressive, and every brew we tried was crafted to perfection. Each sip showcased the brewery's commitment to quality and creativity.\n\nThe atmosphere was welcoming and laid-back — perfect for enjoying a great meal with friends. The staff was friendly and attentive, making our experience even more enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Equilibrium Bonfire Brewery for anyone looking for delicious food and outstanding craft beer. We can’t wait to return!"
