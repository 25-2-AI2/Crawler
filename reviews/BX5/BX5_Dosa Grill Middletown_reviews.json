If you do not regularly eat spicy food, stick with mild as the spicy curry flavors are insanely spicy, I was dribbling snot and crying through my meal but it was so good that I couldn't stop myself from eating the whole bowl of curry. All the food was really really good, I tried everyone else curries and and sides they were all really great. This is my new favorite spot in Middletown, I hope they keep up the quality!"

The food was authentic, bursting with spicy flavors, as should be the case.  They didn't skimp on spices or quality ingredients- the meats were also very fresh- and most importantly, they didn't dull down the flavors to cater to the bland palate.  If you're looking for quality, real, authentic Indian food in the otherwise ethnic food desert of Orange County, give Dosa Grill a try."

Everything was spiced well and the byriani was delicious !!\nThe rice pudding is broken rice with so much great anisé and black cardamom flavor it was the best I’ve ever had. It was my first time having dosa, it fell apart when I picked it up,  or sure if that’s normal as I’ve never had it but the potato chili filling was spicy and very good.\n\nA few suggestions, get some music in there. Indian music is so beautiful and would complement the atmosphere. The buffet food was not hot, more like room temp. If the food was hot and the music was on I’d say this place was perfect. I can’t wait to go back!!"

Every dish was full of authentic flavors, perfectly spiced, and freshly prepared. The dosas were crisp and delicious, and the sambar and chutneys complemented them beautifully.\n\nOverall, Dosa Grill offers a warm atmosphere, fantastic service, and some of the best South Indian cuisine I’ve ever had. Highly recommended for anyone craving authentic flavors and a great dining experience! 🌟"

            "text": "Visited this newly opened dosa spot on their second day. We were seated right away, and though they were still setting up a few things, the decor was cute and welcoming.\n\nWe tried the mango lassi, which was a bit on the thick side. The dosa itself wasn’t quite as crispy as expected and slightly oily, and the sambhar felt more like a daal than a traditional sambhar. On the other hand, the fish fry was absolutely delicious and the Indo-Chinese dishes were also very flavorful.\n\nIt was nice to see they have both a Punjabi and a South Indian chef, which makes for an interesting and varied menu. Service was good, though they could definitely benefit from setting up some music to enhance the ambience."

The minced lamb was flavorful (highly recommended).\n\nAs our main dishes, we ordered the okra with rice and a butter masala dosa. Both dishes were very tasty.\n\nThe rice pudding was very fresh.\n\nOur complements to the chef.\n\nOur server Yash was very attentive and informative.\n\nThis place is a definite hit."
