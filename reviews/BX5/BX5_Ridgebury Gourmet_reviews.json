The prosciutto tutto sandwich is incredible, made with fresh ingredients and the loveliest French baguette bread I’ve ever had on this side of the river. The croissants are also some of the most authentic French croissants I’ve had in the states. SO delicious and I am looking forward to the next time I pick up food here."

I am French and it was impossible for me to find authentic French food not just in the region but in the US (including fine dining restaurants) until I found this gem. I am really impressed by what comes out of Chef Pierrel’s kitchen.\n\nThe taste is delicious, the ingredients are fresh and sourced locally or imported from France, the portions are good and the price is reasonable. The menu seems to change depending on the season. The French chef not only does great-tasting dishes, but also amazing pastry and desserts too! The chocolatine croissant and French baguette remind me of bakeries in France. The crème brûlée, chocolate mousse and pear tart (with frangipane aka almond paste) are all amazing too! The soups are so flavorful and natural. On top of that, the chef is very nice and has a great sense of humor.\n\nIt is a take-out place (although I’ve seen a table outside and a small bar/counter with stools inside next to the coffee area). Everything (besides the pastry and desserts) are made right away once ordered so it’s best to call prior to coming. I wish I was living nearby so I could come often, I will definitely come back when I’m in the area!"
