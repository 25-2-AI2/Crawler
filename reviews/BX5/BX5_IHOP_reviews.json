I mean they probably have enough sugar to run a small country but God are they good.  Keep in mind I do not like pancakes. I dont eat them often.  But I really liked these.\n\nStaff was courteous and attentive.  Location was super clean and staff was actively cleaning.\n\nThings to keep in mind, this review is based on a night where it was raining and slow so I cannot attest to how service is during peak times but off peak service is great.  I will be coming back."

The restaurant was generally dirty, but the condition of the high chair was appalling—it was a greasy, unkempt mess. The floors were dirty as well. Compounding this, the food was poor: my meal was cold, and the French toast tasted microwaved. My child's pancake also lacked the expected smiley face because the staff didn't bother to ask for my preference during the order. Given these significant issues, I won't be coming back.."
