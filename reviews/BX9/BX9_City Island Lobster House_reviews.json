The past few visits have been disappointing. The food looks and tastes good. However, 6/8 of us were ill within stomach aches within an hour of leaving the restaurant.  We will not be returning after many years of loving The Lobster House in City Island."

            "text": "LOBSTER HOUSE – CITY ISLAND, NY\nI brought my daughter to LOBSTER HOUSE in CITY ISLAND, NY to celebrate her birthday, which was on Sunday. I decided to come today instead so it would be less crowded. I have two favorite restaurants on City Island, but my daughter really wanted to try Lobster House — and I wish we hadn’t.\nWe arrived around 12 PM, and the place wasn’t packed at all. I wanted to sit outside, but right away I noticed a black rug on the floor that looked like it hadn’t been swept in days. Then I noticed that the silverware didn’t look clean, which made me uncomfortable before I even got my food.\nOur waiter was awesome, the only positive part of our visit, but unfortunately, everything else went downhill from there. I ordered the steak and lobster tail, and when the food came out, the onion rings on top of my steak were cold, and so was the lobster tail. The only thing warm on the plate was the baked potato, which ended up being the only thing I ate. I packed up the rest to go, completely disappointed.\nTo make it worse, one of the Spanish employees was talking about customers in Spanish, not realizing I speak Spanish too. That was unprofessional and disrespectful.\nMy bill came to almost $150, and I have never paid that much for cold steak and lobster in my life. My virgin piña colada was watered down, like it came from an old, overused machine.\nThis was honestly the worst dining experience I’ve ever had. I was ready to throw my food to the seagulls outside. The ONLY good Experience was my Waiter. I will NEVER come back to LOBSTER HOUSE in CITY ISLAND, NY."

            "text": "I went on October 5th.  The food as always was delicious. The service was good. The atmosphere, not  good, because there was a loud party completely inconsiderate of others with non stop  loud talking and cackling laughter. (Not the restaurants fault). When we left, the valet brought my car, a  2023 Genesis. I immediately noticed that a plastic piece was hanging from the bumper cover. I then saw that the bumper drape on the passenger front was indented, there was a cut in the bumper and the bottom passenger side headlight lens was cracked. The valet attendant denied responsibility, and didn't make eye contact.\nI spoke to the owner. He immediately defended his valet parking attendants like an overprotective  parent would defend his child. This was without even asking the attendants or viewing the damage. He was very defensive telling me the damage was preexisting. It almost seemed like he already was aware this happened. He made several stupid comments including claiming that it couldn't have happened in his lot because the valets back the cars in. Moronic. I said another car could have easily clipped my bumper while the attendant was backing in. He did not want to hear it, claimed his valets are perfect and that they would have immediately informed him had if they were responsible.(maybe they did). He denied  having cameras and walked away.\nI took the car to a collision place. The estimate is between $5000-$6000. I would never go back. The owner is rude, takes no responsibility, and who knows what else he'll say couldn't  happen in his restaurant as evidenced by other 0ne star reviews."

Fresh and good portions! Service was great! Danielle was our waitress. She was super friendly and attentive! The white sangria was delicious!  It is great to know that there is still a family owned establishment that values great service and even greater food. On our way out we stopped to chat quickly with Joe the owner! Kudos to you and your team! I highly recommend this restaurant! When back in the area, we'll definitely visit again!!"

My date had been there before and enjoyed it, so my expectations were pretty high.\n\nThe food was tasty and the service was okay, but honestly, I left feeling a bit disappointed. I wanted to sit by the edge to enjoy the ocean view, but we were told those tables were only for large groups, so my partner and I (just the two of us) weren’t allowed to sit there.\n\nWhat really confused me was that a group of three came in shortly after. They could have easily sat at one of the smaller tables, but the staff brought out a table and let them sit right by the edge — exactly where we had asked to sit.\n\nSo while the food was good, the experience didn’t meet my expectations, especially after all the great things I had heard. I just expected a little more."

He told us the $50 special was a great price and everything was fresh. Clams, mussels a 1 1/25 pound lobster. Soup. Bread and salad and dessert. We said let’s do it. Will come back for the 3 pounder another time . Well. Phenomenal.  Out of this world. Everything was so FRESH AND DELICIOUS. Billy was right!!  Will never go back to anything else other than this special. French fries were great too. Billy even gave us an amaretto shot at the end.  Best waiter ever. Thank you Billy.  See you soon."

My wife’s brother (whose taste in restaurants is good) has been talking this place up to me for years so expectations were high….\n\nAnd not met! It was super crowded and the restaurant seemed to clearly be unable to handle the volume of Easter service. I say this for a few reasons. 1. The menu was drastically reduced, basically pushing you to get lobster tails or crab. 2. The wait staff were clearly overwhelmed and (at least our server) dealt with this by being inattentive and incredibly rude. 3. (Related to 1) all the seafood tasted like it had been cooked in big batches and then microwaved to reheat.\n\nI ordered shrimp and scallop broiled combo which came with a lobster tail (even though I  didn’t order it). The lobster tail meat was so hard you couldn’t even cut it with a steak knife. The scallops were good though they were soggy from sitting in a bath of butter dumped everywhere (see picture). The shrimp were rubbery.\n\nThe only truly good thing was the calamari"

            "text": "Food: starts you off with free garlic bread and salad, which were both high quality and did not feel like just pass off items. We ordered the BBQ feast for 2. Be advised that this meal can feed 4-5 persons with leftovers for a doggie bag. Especially if you already ate the garlic bread, salad and an app. Seafood was fresh! The jumbo shrimp was massive. Crab and lobster did not disappoint and the ribs and chicken were tender and tasty. Drinks were just right and priced well. 5 stars ⭐️\n\nService: firstly, there is valet parking and they didn’t even expect a tip 💯. Food service was one of the best I’ve received at a restaurant. Note: it’s not a buttoned up fancy dining, so the waiters are relaxed, friendly, inviting, they’re pretty much easy going beach dudes who will chat you up while you booze up. Shout out to Billy, our server who was the chillest dude ever! 5 stars ⭐️\n\nAtmosphere: The chairs and tables are basic, nothing fancy about the furniture and I think that’s intentional to match the vibe. Sit on the outside for the sunset view. Take in the yachts and the swan families while you dine. When you’re finished dining, take a walk on the dock and snap some pics with your date or your family to remember the vibe. 5 stars ⭐️\n\nI will highly recommend this spot for city folk from the other boroughs who want to get out of the hustle and enjoy something different: fresh seafood, a chill vibe, nice ambiance."

            "text": "Fantastic restaurant, total NY style experience, it’s my go to for special occasions.  Tonight we had a typically great meal as always.  The food is always fresh, perfectly cooked and prepared.  Billy and Israel were our servers, they make you feel like your family very attentive to your needs. We sat outside overlooking the bay, the atmosphere is amazing the sun setting on the bay is magical.   We celebrated my wife’s birthday, she was so happy.  They start off with salad and plate of cheese when you get seated, then bring you garlic bread that is so delicious that you want to order more but shouldn’t.  Then we had steamers, fried calamari for appetizers absolutely delicious melt in your mouth.  My son ordered prime rib perfectly cooked medium rare.  My other son ordered chicken parmigiana outstanding.  I ordered shrimp scampi over linguine, my wife got the broiled seafood platter.  Everything is great every bite is epic.  Something to consider when coming here, the portions are huge so come on an empty stomach!!  If your trying to watch your calories these meals are easily split between two people.  Highly recommend this restaurant."

For 5 people we paid $360+ with a tip. I would say this is the best location for seafood in all of city island. There is a reason this place is separated from all other restaurants in CI. Families, couples, even children love coming here. One night, they sang 3 birthday songs in a row. This place is serious business and I wish them well in the future. GEMS OF THE BRONX!"

Steven the waiter was wonderful and kind and very attentive.  Happy eating.\nCame back the next day to eat some more and was greeted by a nasty valet male who was real adamant about parking my car.  I went to park my own car and then when he spotted me he told me I would have to leave back out and wait for him to park my car. I left out alright and went to Sammy’s down the street. I’ve been going to this restaurant for years. I got turned away and asked to leave because I did not allow this fake valet man inside of my car to park it.\nThe nerve"

No one playing  games  !!!! FOOD WAS AMAZING! 😋 the waiters  Oscar and Jorge  were incredible 👏🙌, no time to ask for anything,  they got it under control.\nUntil the  end.\nJust take a look at the  pictures, and you will agree with me, The desert  was to die for, the cheesecake  unbelievably delicious.\nForgot to take pictures until I was almost finished. I was sooooo excited 😊 .\nYou will see the leftovers. One good detail I have never seen in Florida is\nI was very  surprised,  They  provided  us with some warm towels to clean  our hands .\nThank you  for this great experience, and we chose this  great restaurant to celebrate our lovely cousin Eileen's birthday 🎂  and had the best quality time with  our family.\n\nLove this place !!!\nWe will return to  this amazing place !!!"
