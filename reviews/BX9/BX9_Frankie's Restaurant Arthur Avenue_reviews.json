THERE WAS A POINT  where poeple just  came on in. They were attend way better than us. They got there foodn drinks faster, and waitress showed up to their table and others way more. I don't know why theydid that. But when they came to use they sound nice. There was a point where I asked what drinks do they have because every drink we asked, they did have. The waitress told me what they did haven and didn't. Just to leave and come back to say they did have it. They had no free bread or butter. The food was really good though.\nThis goes without saying but we were nice and respectful. My mom was treated the best, even though we all wait along time for ever and they did ignor her too."

The food is absolutely delicious. The fried calamari was perfectly fried, the lobster ravioli was soooo yummy, and I enjoyed the pepperoni hot honey pizza as well. Everyone in my party enjoyed their food. My passion fruit margarita was really good too, as were the espresso martini, cheesecake and pistachio ice cream. I highly recommend this hidden gem and will definitely return next time I’m in the area."

It was very busy on Saturday and i was so glad i made reservations. After checking in, we were seated right away. The owner Nick came and introduced himself and brought us a bottle to celebrate. We were given garlic knots as well and they were sooo good and fresh. We ordered Caesar salads, i had cacio e Pepe with shrimp and my husband had bolognese with meat sauce. Everything was made to perfection and fresh! We also ordered one of each dessert which were both phenomenal. There was a group of people that came in singing making the night more fun and romantic.\n\nThey are a cash only restaurant which is important to keep in mind. We didn’t know this and my husband had to take money out of their on-site atm but this is something to know ahead of time for sure. The restaurant is clean, the bathrooms were super clean! This is a small intimate location but well worth it! I already can’t wait to come back and i thank the staff and owner for a great 10th anniversary dinner to remember !"

They started us off with complimentary garlic knots, and wow—so good! We ordered the pear salad, spaghetti and meatballs, and chicken alla vodka. Every dish was excellent—flavorful, fresh, and perfectly cooked.\n\nThe service was just as impressive. The staff was friendly, attentive, and our food came out quickly.

Wine bottles on the walls, “brick” line walls, and those wonderful, heavy wooden tables.\n\nThe service is great and we never had to wait more than a few minutes before someone from their attentive staff checked on us.\n\nThe warm house bread is delicious, but not served with the usual plate of olive oil and cracked pepper, so we asked for them and were given olive oil and parmesan which turned out to be a nice pairing for the bread.\n\nFor a starter we shared the pear salad, which was delicious. I avoided the feta, but didn’t mind the slight sharp flavor the smaller crumbles provided. The candied walnuts were flavorful and the pear slices were delicious. I also enjoyed the vinaigrette. This was a great starter.\n\nMy dining companions ordered the shrimp pasta (mildly spicy) and lasagna. Both had a great flavor. Frankie’s sauce game is on point. I ordered the broccoli rabe and added mushrooms (highly recommended if you’re a fungi fan). The sausage was flavorful and the dish was well oiled. Hopefully the leftovers will retain the flavor.\n\nI suggest making reservations, especially if the weather is nice."

It seems that Little Italy has shrunk, but the staples are still thriving.\n\nWe decided to grab Lunch at Frankie’s, it was 2:15pm on Saturday. Only a couple tables including ours were occupied. Service was good but the food just was ok.\n\nWe started with the Pear Salad w/o the feta. The salad was fresh, crisps and had a nice balance.\n\nI ordered Shrimp Scampi and a glass of white wine. As foodie I rarely mention or complain about price in my reviews. I feel that you pay for great food and good experiences. (We also all know that everything has increased) Needless to say my entrée of pasta and shrimp wasn’t not as flavorful as I would have hoped, and my shrimps were overcooked. Disappointing at almost $40 bucks. (Full disclaimer it was $36). My friend order spaghetti and meatballs and also wasn’t blown away.\n\nBoth dishes are basics which I expected to be perfected and executed with ease at an Italian restaurant.\n\nOverall it was enjoyable to catch up with an old friend and take in a bit of nostalgia while walking down Arthur Ave.\n\nJust A Note:\n\nWe enjoyed the pear salad and appreciated the service."

They’re also very good about substitutions for any vegetarians. Desa is super friendly and down to earth! Thank you Desa, for your kindness. You are the best!"

I’ve ordered from here before, months ago, and the food was completely different—this time, it was a disaster. The pasta looked and tasted like the cheapest commercial kind you can find in a supermarket. Absolutely no care or quality in the preparation.\n\nI spent $80 through Uber Eats, and it feels like money thrown in the trash. I didn’t lose my money , you lost a customer. Never ordering from here again. What happened to the standard you used to have?"
