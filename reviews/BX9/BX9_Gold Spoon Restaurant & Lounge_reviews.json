            "text": "So im not sure what's going on but past 3 to 4 months the restaurant has been extremely slow with service and with online deliveries. The issue that would solve half their problems is to update the actual site to what's in stock . I've called the store and asked if an item is available before placing an order and was told yes its available to order. I place the order and wait an additional 45mins to an hour before its delivered. I callback to ask why the long wait' oh its because we are making it now. Ok so why not mention that when I called?. I placed an order for 2 meals and instead of calling me or asking if I'd substitute it for something else or maybe even canceling the order they charge me for a side order. Why would you send a'small side order and have me pay for delivery fees and tip for a small side order.  Im so pissed at the inconsiderate and poor service. The food is decent and I love that they're 24hrs. But I will only use take out going forward and suggest others to not waste time and energy on delivery from here. I hope you guys read this and make the changes asap. Waited almost an hour only to receive a small side order of Mac  is crazy."

There are three different entrances, one for takeout, one for the bar, and another for what I assume is the sit down restaurant. It’s not clear at all where you're supposed to go, which already set a bad tone. We waited inside for a few minutes, but no one was there to greet us. We finally asked the takeout staff if anyone was coming to our table, and they just vaguely said, \"Yeah, someone should be there.\" So we went back to the seating area and waited some more. Meanwhile, the bartender was just watching us with a confused look, but not once did anyone come over to ask if we needed help or to greet us properly. After wasting our time and feeling completely ignored, we decided to leave and will definitely not be returning. Truly disappointing experience poor organization and even worse customer service."

The place is super clean! Buffet style food for you to pick. I had some delicious jerk wings and Chicken rasta pasta. They could have put more chicken in there. I had basically rasta pasta with veggies. But still it was good! Had a side of collard greens... honestly this could use improvement coming from a southern girl. Greens had no flavor whatsoever. There's a huge sit down restaurant side with TVs and a huge bar for drinks! The staff was polite... appreciated that! Would definitely visit again. They have a big selection of food!

Tasha call me that they were out of salt Fish fritters and chicken soup. While Uber eats was trying to charge me full price. Tasha told me to cancel the order and that she would still make the food for me, and I would just have to re-order it again. I did exactly what she said. Because, Word to the Wise: “Uber Eats will not let you cancel unless you speak to an agent.” I was frustrated, hungry, and upset that I had no food at the time, and no delivery man. I had two cancellations from two delivery men, and Tasha still took my order and the food was delicious. Not only was a delicious, but it was full. Tasha, thank you for making my curry goat good and thank you for filling my belly full. I will continue to order food here, please just have the oxtails for me next time. But the food was good. May Jah pour blessings into yuh for real ❤️"

Everyone goes crazy about Jamaican food and they should, we West Indian folks are serious about our food and it shows; however, I’m here to tell you about breakfast, so this isn’t a rice and peas/oxtail review, this is the mother of all things Porridge review. Most Jamaican restaurants sell porridge (plantains, peanuts) hot cereal breakfast but for me it’s the combination of texture, taste, freshness, density and not trying to hide this flavor in sugar. This porridge literally gives me life. You get a quart size for $7 you can easily feed three ppl with this, but it will be two for me, small single serving may be half that price. With the weather getting cooler, it’s good on your tummy and will definitely hold you to lunchtime. We paired ours with a salt fish fritter. This was a treat since we relocated and are just visiting family. My only complaint is customer service goes a long way, put napkins in the bag and when the customer comes back to get some don’t be stingy  listen go get that!!!"

            "text": "So I normally go here for just the take out side the food is always good. This Tuesday I decided to do the happy hour and try the restaurant side for the first time. I was meeting a friend but I arrived first I was given a okay greeting by the bartender no name given the place was not crowded and good music. I asked about the happy hour and ordered a mango margarita to start which took awhile to be made by the bartender. I then ordered tacos on the menu the variety is not listed so you will have to inquire as I did. I ordered oxtail tacos. Although flavorful the taco tortilla was not warmed up and toasted to hold the inside well so it fell apart and was messy. My friend arrived and agreed they were good just needed to be toasted afterwards I finished my first drink and ordered the same drink again my friend ordered jack with ginger ale. My friend mentioned to the bartender the drink wasn't as strong she seems offended but the drink barely had jack in it. And my drink tasted like juice and I know my margaritas well but ,I drunk it and left it at that. We wanted to order more food but it seemed even though we would try to get her attention she avoided us and had a attitude. My friend  asked me what's going on I said I don't know but we then decided to just go. So I asked for the bill. I did notice the bartender  engage more and attended the other customers across from us a lot better then myself and my friend. Good customer service goes a long way we would have stayed longer had the service been a lot better and I'm always suggesting places for future places but doubt I would. Maybe another day of the week would be a better outcome who knows take your chances."

Despite the menu prices advertised, I was shocked to find that the actual bill was higher than expected. Moreover, the staff's attitude was remarkably rude, adding to the unpleasant experience. Additionally, they prominently display a sign stating a 3% charge for credit card usage and a 3% discount for cash payments, but they never honored the discount for cash payments. Overall, I was left feeling dissatisfied and misled by both the pricing discrepancies and the staff's behavior."
