Where do they do that at.. next I asked for spicy shrimp which was spice but some shrimp were must and for some reason he stated to another customer that he's giving me extra and he didn't not sure why he stated that but he never gave me no damn extra.. the chicken soup can use more flavor and the oxtail tender but sweet not that sweet but they can hold off just a lil on the sweetness.. besides having peas in my cabbage which I don't like.. it's pretty much just steamed up with other veggies..  Will not be returning due to that rude staff tried to skip my man and daughter and not very welcoming.. the workers seems burnt out and not really happy.. wanted to add after that rude staff and I already ordered my daughter and my man did not place an order and I could've kept my $40"

            "text": "I’ve been a customer for many years at this restaurant on any given day the food fluctuate my favorite food are lacking flavors, spice and the heart of what this restaurant was about. My last visit three weeks ago was very disappointing. Only thing I’ll probably stop here for is the sorrel when I’m in the Bronx. I purchase the chicken foot (no spice was not season properly), fried chicken (lack its true flavor), stew peas (horrible) chicken soup (salt and not its usual taste). Seems changes in chef as it’s lost its original taste. I’m loyal to a fault and have been coming back hoping they’ll get it but I’m tired as I did not eat some of the above it just sat in the refrigerator until it was time to throw out. I gave it a three because the staff and owner is nice.\n\nI just want to add to my review I was desperate and went there against my judgement again. I got the curry chicken feet, jerk chicken pasta. The chicken feet nails was not removed I was so gross out I ended up throwing that food out I don’t think I can eat chicken feet for a while. My son did not eat the pasta I bought for him usually he would eat it but he let it stay in the refrigerator for a week before I threw it out. I dropped my ratings to two stars because for the most part Americans think this is a great food place but as a Jamaican I won’t ever visit this place for food again only for the drinks as my daughter like their passion fruit and I like the sorrel if the flavor does not change."

Gold star food is 100% authentic Jamaican food. I had fried chicken rice and peas with raw vegetables, with a little stew chicken gravy. It reminded me of home in Mandeville Jamaica. Sooo flavorful! The restaurant decor was beautiful too, and all of the staff looked presentable and were very professional. I will definitely be taking the trip to New York just to have Goldstar again. Delicious! ❤️💛💚"

The customers had to let the woman working know I was next and she rolled her eyes. The plate was very sloppy and only half filled both times.\n\nOn 7/25/2025 I went into the grocery store next door and as I ordered a sandwich in Spanish an older woman with the GoldStar uniform screamed out “speak English please”. The other female employee and a man that was with them laughed. I asked her in English who she was talking to and they hurried out of the store."

Now, there wasn't any dancing happening but it's not because the music wasn't fire! DJ Dougie really did his thing here.\n\nNow the food, the selection seemed endless!! We ended up getting white rice, rice and peas, curry goat, oxtails, sweet and sour chicken, cabbage, mac and cheese, plantains, and one of each drink they serve. Everything. Was. Delicious. The serving sizes were generous. It fed us yesterday and today! The goat and oxtails were tender and so flavorful. The lemonade and the fruit punch had a twist, with some ginger. But the pink drink was sweet and tangy. 10/10 would recommend. The seating options are limited, but If you are able to snag on and enjoy the music with the food, it's all worth it!!"

The jerk chicken was seasoned to perfection, with the right blend of spice and smokiness that defines a true Jamaican jerk. The curry chicken was tender and full of rich, complex flavors, and the stews were hearty and comforting. You can taste the love and tradition in every bite, and it’s clear that quality ingredients and skilled preparation are at the heart of everything they serve.\n\nIf you're looking for genuine Jamaican cuisine, Gold Star is the spot. Highly recommend trying everything on the menu; you won’t be disappointed!"
