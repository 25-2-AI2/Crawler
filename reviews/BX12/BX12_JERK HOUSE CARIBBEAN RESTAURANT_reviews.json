The fried chicken was extremely dry, and I was unexpectedly charged an additional $2–$3 for just three small plantains. While the mac and cheese was the only item that stood out in terms of quality, the rest of the meal did not meet expectations—especially for the $19 total cost.\nAdditionally, it would be helpful if staff clearly communicated any extra charges before adding items to the plate. Transparency around pricing would go a long way in improving the customer experience."

But the real star of the show was the food! Every bite was tantalizing — packed with bold, authentic flavors that left me wanting more. The sweet chilli chicken was perfectly seasoned, juicy, and absolutely delicious. You can tell everything is made with care and passion. If you’re craving Caribbean flavor done right, Jerk House is the place to go. Highly recommend! Check out my full review on TikTok @foodiegirlnyc"

Curry goat was dry. Rice and peas tasted terribly. Wings and Mac &cheese were the worse I’ve ever had (wings were soggy) The only redeemable food here was the oxtail which I’d give a 6/10 and that me being nice. Again as a Jamaican who knows how authentic Jamaican food tastes, this is NOT the place you want to waste $20 in a meal for. Hope this helps.🫶🏽"

Other places may taste better on certain days, but this place is always consistently good, pork is always juicy, occasional dry piece but the meat overall is good.  You can get a meal with just steamed veg if you like, and the steamed veg is real good here.  Slightly on the saltier side, but tasty and goes well with the meal.  Before the pandemic they used to have hand-made beef patties. Have not seen those in a while but highly recommend those when they come back.\nStaff always pleasant.  Always.

I appreciate that the chicken held that jerk flavor, but was not overly spice or dry.

Snapper dinner say $20 on the manu and they charged me $25, Jerk fried rice they told me $3 more and they charge me $3,75.  The food was cold the shrimp was ok.   Just so over priced. I will not recommend or even ever visit again... for the price the food is nonsense"

            "text": "When I heard there was a place called jerk house my 1st thought was,  just another Caribbean Restaurant.  Well, was  i wrong. This place is absolutely fantastic. Very  clean, large selection of food ,  fantastic prices and the service is outstanding. I ordered the oxtails $18 , typically in a Caribbean restaurants  The oxtails get picked through and you get mostly rice , Not here they gave me plenty of Oxtails a nice portion of rice and a  Healthy amount of Steamed cabbage (cooked perfectly) and the food was delicious. My brother ordered 2 plates of Brown  Stew chicken $16 per plate,  one for him  1 for my mom , They could have shared a plate there was enough food for 4 people. The food is served hot it is fresh it is tasty it is not over spiced it is plain and simply delicious. I have traveled to Jamaica at least a dozen times , montego Bay's hipstrip would go crazy for a place like this. The tourist myself included , (although I'm not quite a tourist at this point),  would stay in a restaurant that served this Quality of food.   If you are looking for delicious  Plate of authentic tasting Caribbean Food I suggest you give this place a try.  I will certainly be returning, I intend to try  the fried shrimp, The red snapper ( in a red sauce)and I must give those spicy wings a shot.  As a person who has eaten  At  many many restaurants,  if I had to give this place a rating 1 to 5 (1 being worth 5 being best)  I would like to offer them a 6 for  Such great service with  Such a Great smile. Give them a try."
