It was tender, meat fell off the bone and flavorful.\n\nNow to complete this review was what I witnessed before I left the establishment,  the chef was offering a gentleman who seemed to be down on his luck, a hot meal.

            "text": "During my recent visit to Island Grill, I was deeply impressed by Simone, the front desk personnel whose professionalism and attention to hygiene truly set the gold standard for the restaurant industry. As someone living with a disability and an autoimmune disease, I am always conscious of food safety protocols, particularly in environments where employees handle both cash and food. Simone demonstrates exemplary discipline; she changes her gloves promptly after each transaction, ensuring a sanitary barrier with every customer interaction. Her diligence reflects not only personal integrity but a standard that every employee in the food service industry should uphold.\n\nBeyond excellent service, Island Grill continues to distinguish itself through its authentic Jamaican flavors. I particularly enjoy the Jamaican Red Peas Soup﻿ with chicken, dumplings, green bananas, dasheen, and corn, as well as the chicken soup. Each dish embodies the warmth and rich culture of Jamaica in every spoonful.\n\nI also wish to commend the owner, Marvin, whose continued commitment to health and safety ensures that his staff consistently wear gloves when serving patrons. His leadership reinforces a culture of accountability and care that customers like me deeply appreciate.\n\nIsland Grill is not only a place to enjoy nourishing Jamaican cuisine; it is an establishment that exemplifies integrity, hospitality, and respect for all guests."

The lady behind the counter is really nice and patient, she did not rush me when I couldn’t decide what to get. I definitely recommend this place and will come again."

We found Island Grill and it was truly an unbelievable treat.\n\nI had the jerk chicken with mashed potatoes and topped it with gravy from the oxtail. Every bite was full of rich flavor and the chicken was perfectly cooked. I also had a Jamaican cream soda by DG which hit the spot. My daughter had the jerk chicken with rice and their in house pasta, which was absolutely incredible. The pasta is a flavor explosion and one of the best things we have ever tasted.\n\nThe two ladies behind the counter were so nice and helpful. They even let us sample a few things to make sure we got exactly what we wanted. That kind of service made the whole experience even better."

The food is delicious and fresh and you definitely get your moneys worth and more. Portions are generous and prices are great! I usually order on uber eats and get their BOGO. One of my kids like white rice and one like rice n peas. I just request them to accommodate my preferences on the note section of the app and call to confirm. Omg again! Their customer service is impeccable!!! I've lived around this area for a ling time and tried most of the restaurants around here but never have I experienced such consistent, wonderful,  friendly,  accommodating service! I am going to make my way into the store one of these days just so I can thank these employees in person. I'm currently awaiting my order of curry goat and stew chicken both which I'm trying for the first time but I've attached pics of my previous order to this review which was curry chicken and jerk chicken. Both were on point! And at BOGO, u can't go wrong!  I honestly wish the very very best to this business because they deserve it. I will choose this spot again and again and I hope they stay consistent with their delicious food and one of a kind, refreshing customer service.  Thank you so much island grill. You guys are doing an amazing job and I hope you continue to flourish and prosper.\n\nUPDATE 8/21/2025 : Unfortunately this place is slipping. The BOGO on Uber eats are not BOGO but instead just one medium meal. Called restaurant to inquire and the young man who answered was extremely rude and unhelpfull and hung up on me. When I called back he refused to answer my calls. Bought a BOGO Stew chicken like I been doing several times a week since I first discovered this place and received only 1. I called back week after to clarify because I wanted to order again and the nice woman told me the owner has made some changes but it doesn't reflect on the Uber eats menu so that is confusing as a patron. The food was good but unfortunately I haven't ordered nor will I be ordering again in the future and I've stopped recommending and sending my people here. So sad this place is changing..I really thought this would be my go to but they fumbled. On to the next. Changed my rating from 5 to 2 stars due to the way I was treated and the false advertisement."

I paired it with homemade mashed potatoes, topped with rich stew gravy and jerk sauce that brought everything together beautifully.\n\nTo top it off, I had it with an ice-cold Jamaican Cream soda. Listennn… Delicious! 🤤\n\nThe service was excellent — big shout out to Shauna, who was quick and on point with preparing my meal.

            "text": "I wouldn’t advise anyone to order from these ppl. My last 3 consecutive orders were cancelled due to their unprofessionalism. I ordered online drove there in the morning to pick up breakfast. The door was locked they were inside. They were late to open and couldn’t even be decent enough to come to the door and say that. They just looked at me so I when you GOLDSTAR instead. Which I’ve always had a good experience with. It’s not too far just go there instead.\n\n2nd time they did not confirm my order so it was cancelled so I had to pay twice since refunds aren’t instant.\n\nToday SEP 1st I order and they cancelled my order, that I was charged for. I called and some nonchalant careless man told me we’re closed. If they are closed why are they taking orders from Grubhub. Ppl are charged for that and they don’t get instant refunds. I told him if that was my last money I wouldn’t have nothing to eat and that’s wrong to do to customers. His response was as I said we are closed and I’m trying to clean.\n\nThis is the attitude of an entitled rude establishment as if they are the only Caribbean restaurant in the area. One thing I won’t do is lie,  I’ve had better but the food good. HOWEVER it’s NOT good enough for the disrespectful, dismissive, nonchalant, rude customer service. Hence why I only support good black business. This isn’t one of them they don’t have the customer service skills to prosper.They operate from entitlement not appreciation for their customers. I’ll take my consistent coin somewhere else. What a shame,"

The ambience is cozy and clean, with a few tables if you’d like to dine in, but I decided to take my meal to go.\n\nI ordered the hot, fresh ackee and saltfish with a side of callaloo and fried dumplings, and let me tell you—it made my soul smile! Every bite was flavorful, authentic, and cooked to perfection. I literally had a pep in my step after finishing my breakfast.\n\nThe best part, though, is the outstanding customer service from the beautiful women who run the front. That kind of warmth and hospitality is rare to find when ordering Jamaican food in New York, and it truly sets Island Grill apart.\n\nThis spot has been around for about a year now, and I sincerely hope it stays for many more. I’ll definitely be recommending Island Grill to all my family and friends—Bronx, you’ve got a real treasure here!"

They were very tender, seasoned to perfection, the gravy was amazing, rice and peas were very well prepared.. However, the portion wasn't good at all.. I know everything is going up but oxtails aren't that expensive anymore for them to charge almost $20 for a portion size suitable for a small child.   Other than that the food was great.. I'm gonna assume they do better in person as opposed to Door Dash because despite how good they are that portion was a little ridiculous....."

What really sealed the deal was the outstanding customer service—not just from one person, but from the entire staff. Everyone greeted me warmly and made me feel like my satisfaction truly mattered. Even though I haven’t tried everything yet, the presentation and cleanliness are top-tier. This is definitely my new go-to lunch spot!"

            "text": "I ordered a large oxtail and large curry goat both with rice and peas and cabbage. In addition to a side of jerk chicken and sweet chili wings. The flavor is unmatched from any authentic Jamaican restaurant in Manhattan. While the oxtail has a more modern flair to it, its flavor and tender texture is incomparable. My favorite was the Jerk chicken, not only does it taste fresh from the grill but the sauce on top was the perfect touch to make my nose run. I didn’t get to ask my lovely server’s name but her customer service is a rarity that New York hasn’t seen in a long time. Her “I’ll see you soon” was not only confident but reassuring as she stands behind her product and that’s not something you see often. I will definitely be back soon."
