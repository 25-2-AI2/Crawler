One of the very few places that still has the authentic food taste, customer service, and atmosphere of an Italian Mom & Pop shop. Also, the owner is a nice guy, not too talkative but the more I frequent the more conversation we start to have. Glad this place is still servicing the Norwood area and I hope it continues to do so!"
