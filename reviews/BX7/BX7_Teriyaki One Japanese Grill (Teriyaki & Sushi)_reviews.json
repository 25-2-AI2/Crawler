It’s not flavorful don’t have that great teriyaki taste it’s just not good to me. The noodles were overcooked and they don’t pack you with a lot of chicken or beef like a true teriyaki place the vegetables were not existent for someone who actually enjoys the vegetables. I wouldn’t wanna have to pay extra for a decent amount of vegetables that supposed to be with my meal. Overall, There’s a pizza shop across the street."

She turned and spoke to the other workers in another language and then they all laughed, including the cashier. I thought that was odd, but I didn't think much of it. After all, I couldn't understand what they were saying. I paid the $11.34 plus tax for the signature roll, and as I waited for my order, I looked at the menu and realized that, since they removed that ingredient, they pretty much charged me $11.34 for a basic roll that is listed at $6.99 on a different part of the menu. That's why they were laughing. When I confronted them about it, they tried to gaslight me because they got caught overcharging me for my food. I thought that was very ugly and dishonest of them. I used to come here regularly, but I certainly won't be back."

We placed the order and received it in less than half an hour I believe 😅\n\nPresentation of the delivered plates: 10/10\n\nWe ordered two bento boxes through an app (door dash I believe) without appetizers because each plate already had great variety - and it only made USD$39!\n\nEach bento box had rice (steamed or fried), choice of meat, green salad, 3 fried dumplings and 2 spring rolls.\n\nI ordered the shrimp bento box and my husband the chicken & beef one - and they were both SO FINE 😂\n\nThe portions were incredible - so MUCH FOOD\n\nReally really good, fresh ingredients - perfectly sliced meats, very well seasoned, all ingredients and components very well cooked, perfectly fried dumplings and spring rolls - the spring rolls were by the way one of the best ones I have ever tried - very tasty rice...\n\nThe most surprising part... everything tasted SO FRESH & HEALTHY... we just loved it!\n\nDo see ourselves ordering again from them to continue trying some of their other dishes.\n\nA great recommendation and option in this area 👍🏻\n\nOk, so - updated my review because.. you know how sometimes you try one place and you ABSOLUTELY LOVE them and then you immediately effusively recommend them to some other people... and you invite them your favorite dish there so that you can enjoy it with them - but it turns out to be PRETTY BAD this time?\n\nOk 😂 this second time we ordered Teriyaki was SO BAD I wouldnt have ever ordered a second time, had this second time been my first 😅\n\nMaybe its too soon since they are fairly new... might give them a try in a couple of months... third is the charm 🤷🏻‍♀️"

            "text": "I've a frequent customer and I have some thoughts. Overall, I enjoy their food. I like their sushi (specialty rolls and regular rolls), the avocado salad, and their teriyaki dishes. They usually give big portions which is nice ( there was an occasion or two where it was skimpy) and they have options - for protein as well as the side.\nTwo issues that I've had with them -\n1 - Their proteins as far as I know have always been boneless - and on one occasion my husband and I had chicken bones in our food which was disconcerting as they were small pieces and if we really bit hard could have done some damage\n\n2 - I usually ask for either all veggie, or majority veggie with a small amount of rice or noodle. I'm going to give up on asking for the latter, for they never do it. I don't know what the problem is with me asking for more veg, but they never do it. They always end up giving me an overwhelming amount or rice/noodles with a small amount of veg. I believe I'm even charged for it. Since I always do take out, its already packed and I never check it. I don't feel like I should have to since I'm always clear with my instructions.\nI'm just going to stop asking for it.\nAgain, this is a great place to eat and you get a bang for your buck, but if you expect a special order forget it."

Also wish the chicken was seasoned with some other flavors besides just teriyaki sauce. The teriyaki sauce doesn't really do much for flavor. Fried rice is just like brown rice with peas and carrots nothing special but not mad at it. The lettuce needed more yum yum sauce it barely had any on it. The spring rolls and dumplings that come with the bento were delicious. I'll come back to try sushi next time. And also try bento again with noodles next. Also want to try there poke bowls as well. But this place is very clea, spacious, and the employees are respectful and friendly. Good service! We needed something different in the neighborhood thank you for bringing this to offer the area."
