The slices are a decent size but nothing to complain about and I come all the way from Kingsbridge Road (197th University) to buy here because it IS worth it and the large pizza pies are $10 and you won't find that price anywhere else as all the pizza places I go to now have the large pies for $15 to $20 which is ridiculous. To me it is worth the trip because if it wasn't, I wouldn't be typing out this review here. To hell with all the pizza spots here on Kingsbridge Road and Bedford Park, this is the one I will be going to from now on."
