The rice texture is like the microwaveable pouch ones and no flavor. The chicken is extremely soft and chewy. For a grill name, this is not grilled. It's like if you stew chicken breast and then add the sauce on top or they add a lot of meat tenderizer or yogurt during marination. It doesn't taste nor feel grilled. The beans are from the can, people that know how to cook, know what I'm talking about. They're very very soft. The tomato tasted like it was sitting there and the guacamole tasted like if you mix rancid old avocado with new ones. The sauce, fajita vegetables and Lettuce are good. But they need to improve on the rice, beans and chicken which is the main reason why people would stop there. The portions are good size, but ya really need to improve and not rush when making bowls. I notice a lot of teens like to come to this spot, obviously the youth nowadays can't tell quality from something that pretends to be \"Mexican grill\""

I ordered two days ago on Uber Eats and I been craving it again so tonight I decided to go in ( they are open late perfect for somebody like me who always has munchies in the middle of the night) it was clean, organized and I was greeted upon walking in. It's not a necessary thing for me. But, I do appreciate you acknowledging I'm here. It's set up like a chipotle, but these ingredients are SO fresh omg. and every topping and condiment they offer plain, they also offer spicy. 😭 I didn't get a chance to get the name of the guy who was helping me today. But there was two gentlemen. The first guy wasn't very knowledgeable about the food. He may have been new,  not sure. But when I asked the other guy if he could explain to me what the set up was he did. He also recommended the honey chipotle chicken which I didn't get the first time. THAT CHICKEN IS SO GOOD. LIKE I recommend to everyone who goes to get the chicken!!! The only thing I could say is I would've appreciated more guacamole but I just ordered another scoop not sure how they're measuring it. The first bowl was what I received on door dash the second is what I got when I went in tonight. I have no complaints which is rare. Go check them out."

What I recommend to remove the doubts of people wanting to know if the food is zabiha or not is to get an HMS certification, they certify hand slaughter restaurants for free. It would definitely bring more customers and remove the doubts of people who think the food may not be zabiha. One problem is I wish the food was more cheaper, a bit expensive."

The “Honey Chipotle Chicken” is an absolute must try! They let you customize your dish with a lot of options to enhance your meal.\n\nBetween the unique sauces and the different kinds of dressings this place is as fun as it gets! Open until 3AM & the staff is super friendly and accommodating. They also offer buy one get one free on ANY dish online through UberEats."
