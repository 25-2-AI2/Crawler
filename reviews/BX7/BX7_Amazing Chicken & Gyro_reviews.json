            "text": "The sandwiches such as the chopped cheese, lamb cheesesteak, and gyro was good. The tostones need seasoning with pink sauce, curly was well seasoning and delicious. The turkey bacon double cheeseburger was good. The pizza roll is terrible it is crap wrapped in egg roll shell. I rather get some real pizza rolls in a pizzeria than eating that garbage again. The service was okay however, when I tell the Muslim brother that rum raisin ice cream is haram because of the rum he acted all nonchalant about it. This is a halal restaurant no alcohol in all forms should not be allowed. Astaghfirullah to brother. The atmosphere was small people coming in and out there is no room to dine and enjoy the food so I glad I ordered to go."

I regularly have ordered chicken breast in their “mixed chicken” option for 4.99 and did an add on piece for 1.99, only to find my order was upcharged 3 dollars because I wanted specifically breasts. The uber eats listing does not let you specify chicken or list individual prices of each piece, and only lets you type it via description. Amazing food, we have been a long time customer,  this review is so their online listings can more accurately reflect their prices.\n\nUpdate: received order and i did not get what I even requested and agreed to over the phone in order to drop the charge. Instead of 1 breast and 2 wings I received 1 thigh and 2 wings.\n\nFurther update. This order was actually correct and i apologize for my error in what i saw. I should have checked more thoroughly. I thought it was a thigh. 🙏🏽"

My favorite plate is the amazing plater which is a combination of rice, salad, fried, pita bread, lamb and chicken for about 14 bucks. They make the portion of each plater worth the amount spend. And, you can tell they care about customers experience by the way they take care of the line during busy times all in maintaining a top notch quality service. Going there is refreshing as it is always guaranteed that you will be served fresh food."
