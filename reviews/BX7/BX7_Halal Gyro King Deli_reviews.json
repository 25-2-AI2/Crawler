The falafel was crispy on the outside, soft and flavorful on the inside, and perfectly seasoned. The rice was fresh and fluffy, and the white sauce and hot sauce combo took it to the next level.\n\nThe portion size was generous too definitely worth the price. The staff were super friendly and quick with the service. I’ll definitely be coming back here whenever I’m in the neighborhood. Highly recommend if you’re craving good halal food in the Bronx!"
