The staff went above and beyond to make sure everything was just right — even surprising my kids with free fries, which absolutely made their day!\n\nNow, the food… wow. Every bite was packed with flavor. We ordered the Chicken Shawarma Ace Bowl, Bacon Cheeseburger, Chicken Shawarma Saj Wrap, and a refreshing lemonade. Each dish was prepared perfectly — the shawarma was juicy and well-seasoned, the burger was indulgent and satisfying, and the wrap was loaded with flavor in every bite. We also asked for extra sauces, and they didn’t hold back — which took everything to the next level.\n\nThe portions were generous, the presentation was inviting, and most importantly, everything tasted fresh and delicious. This is the kind of place that leaves you planning your next visit before you’ve even finished your meal.\n\nAce Shawarma isn’t just another food spot — it’s a gem on Jerome Ave. Highly recommend it to anyone looking for quality food, excellent service, and a genuinely enjoyable dining experience. On top of all this they are HMS CERTIFIED which means they are 100% ACTUAL HALAL FOOD!"

The portions were very generous, although I wish they would have gotten it right in preparing the burger without cheese which I specifically asked for.\n\nBe advised that it's not located the \"nicest\" neighborhood, but that's probably not an issue for you if you are grabbing something to eat in the Bronx."

I ordered a large chicken shawarma poutine for $13 and it shattered my expectations for this restaurant. A solid 8.5/10 will buy again and will try out the rest of the menu! It was so appetizing I literally got the itus and dozed off in the afternoon. That’s rare for me!!! I’m so glad they opened something new nearby that’s so good!!! Thank you!!!"

And the food taste, quality and quantity exceeded my expectations.\n\nI got the chicken shawarma, bacon cheese burger and cheeseburger poutine. All were delicious and the toppings in the shawarma tasted so fresh.\n\nWhen they found out I drove from CT they not only gave me 2 coupons for my next visit but also let me try the tractor dragonfruit drink. It was really good! Not too sweet and very refreshing. Such a cool place and even cooler owners.\n\nOh and the restaurant is brand new.

I was really impressed with his marketing.\n\n3 days later I go with my kids, but Achraf was not working. Next day I come back, I see him and of course I ask him to make my shawarma burger 🤣.

Also must try the juicy cheeseburger made with organic Grass fed beef with added bacon and spicy fries truly hit the spot. Chicken ace bowl is a delight with bursting flavors & tender chicken.  And oh the poutines options add a whole other dimension that’s not found anywhere else in the city. Above all, amazing service and friendly staff that customizes and accommodates meals to fit your preferences!\n🩷🩷🩷"
