This Mcdonald is a really nice place to visit especially with your kids or grandkids. The playground is a great open area and is huge, the kids really enjoy themselves there. the place is clean and the staff are decent. This is a really nice Mcdonalds. I also wanted to add that this particular location doesn't  offer coffee discount for senior citizens. Also, this location doesn't have sugar free syrup for pancakes. I asked the store manager about the sugar free syrup and the response was,\" in all the years I've worked here no customer has ever asked for sugar free syrup\" I was taken back by that response because the Bronx has the highest rate of diabetes among the five boroughs, with 16% of adults diagnosed with the disease. These are statistical facts and that may be higher today. This franchise\nShould consider the senior discounts and diabetes friendly approach. Just my opinion. Otherwise, this Mcdonald's location is very welcoming and a great eat in fast food restaurant."

            "text": ">>WARNING TO ALL CUSTOMER<<\nOn December 3rd 2021, at 300 E 204 St, Bx, NY 10467, McDonald's customer long slow waiting line is so long that it reaches McDonald entrance door, that when sneaky teenagers are goes to the kiosk machine to order their food and chooses the pay at the register option. They don't return back to the line, they sneak up to the register, this is unacceptable for the customers waiting on line. I complained to the assigned McDonald's female manager (Hispanic short female, a little stocky with a hairball Style on top of her head, she was not wearing a name tag or no manager picture on their walls) she ignore me, received no respond and walked away. This is Unbecoming Off! unprofessional display from a supervisor and allowing the teenagers to sneak out from their waiting line, use McDonald's kiosk, chooses the pay at the register option to sneak up in front of the line. Photos are enclosed for proof of the long slow waiting line. 😡\nAt McDonald's, 300 E 204 St, Bx., NY 10467., Their McDonald's small pieces of 4 process with by-product chicken McNuggets for 99 cent went up to 1.39 cent, in fact they raise their prices on most of their items. Other McDonald's in the Bronx prices has not gone up.\nThank God a brand new Popeyes Chicken Restaurant open up across the street on 204 St., their chickens parts are not process, it's real meat! GOODBYE McDonald's! SEE YA, HATE TO BE YA!!"

This manager called Maria is the rudest person I have encountered. She said the same thing about computer not able to discount the drink. I requested that she can give discount since she is the manager. At this point she shouted at me and said no order for me and asked the cashier not to serve me. Her behavior was racist and McDonald's should not be hiring such managers. Hope you will take some disciplinary action."
