Take out as much potato as you want, add water and  add resalt. It brings out the some of that flavor it once had .🤷🏻‍♂️\n\nBeen coming here since I was in my\nMother’s womb.

There's a reason this place has been around so long. Cash only, be prepared. There's a full bar as well.  Kids can get burgers, dogs or nugs. Order and pay at the counter and dining is cafeteria style with great  view of the Long Island sound/East Chester Sound with the Throg Neck bridge in the distance. We make the trip every time we visit NYC, it's worth it. Not a fancy place, just great food and lots of it."

            "text": "Lets just say I was reminiscing on the good ole days when Johnny's seafood was the best and quality was fresh. Came in with a table of 6 and the majority came for the lobster tails and red snapper. What a disappointment with the size of the lobster tails! They are so small and prices doubled !!! I get it...inflation and everything eventually goes up but quality of food has changed drastically! I substituted fries for vegetables...why were the vegetables not fresh but so soggy I wouldn't feed my dog that! Should be ashamed to serve those over cooked disgusting veggies!\nThe line was out the door but it was going fast. Had my friend complain about shrimp tasting different and fries were not as fresh as before. Huge disappointment... I ll venture off to a better quality sea food in the area. I was loyal for over 35yrs. So sad!"

The food lacked flavor, and also, the individual who placed our food in the take-home tray was cleaning the restrooms and emptying the trash before approaching us, without washing her hands prior to handling our food. Nevertheless, the meal was going in the trash anyhow. I would give this location a rating of zero if possible. If you are seeking a rapid seafood establishment in City Island, I advise avoiding this place. The food is not good."
