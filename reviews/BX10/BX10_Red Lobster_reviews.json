The shrimp were juicy with just the right amount of seasoning, and the salmon was beautifully seared, flaky, and full of flavor. Each dish was well-prepared, fresh, and clearly made with quality ingredients.\nThe service was friendly and efficient — staff were attentive without being overbearing. The atmosphere was relaxed and inviting, ideal for both casual dinners and special occasions.\nPricing was fair for the quality of the seafood, and I felt like I got great value for what I paid. If you’re a seafood lover, this place is definitely worth a visit.\n\nTo top it off, I had a Piña Colada, and it was absolutely delicious — smooth, creamy, and refreshing, with just the right balance of coconut and pineapple.\nFatou was our server she was absolutely amazing 👏."

I ordered the Ultimate Feast, and every part of it was delicious—the lobster tail was tender, the crab legs cracked easily with sweet meat inside, and the shrimp were seasoned just right. Even the sides, like the creamy mashed potatoes and fresh broccoli, felt like they were prepared with care.\n\nService:\nThe service was outstanding. Our server was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu. Drinks were refilled quickly, extra biscuits arrived without even having to ask, and everything came out at just the right time. They made us feel genuinely welcome, not rushed.\n\nEnvironment:\nThe atmosphere was relaxed but lively. The restaurant was clean, the lighting was warm, and the nautical décor gave it that cozy seaside vibe. It felt like a place where you could enjoy a casual dinner with family or even celebrate something special.\n\nOverall, Red Lobster delivered on all fronts—great food, excellent service, and a comfortable environment. I’ll definitely be coming back for another round of lobster, shrimp, and those legendary biscuits!"

Our server Q was good I do not have any complaints about him. After receiving our food we barely started eating and a roach started crawling across our table. This is disgusting. This is the first restaurant that I’ve ever experienced this and would not wish this to happen to anyone. Yes the manager offered for us to not pay the bill and to replace our food making it to go. I received my food and after leaving noticed that the food was not all that I ordered to my specifications. At least if you are offering to replace the food and for the restaurant to not have a “bad look” then make sure that the food is to perfection with every order detail correct. I half didn’t even want the food because if the table that we’re eating at has a roach imagine the kitchen. Also, they advised that they fumigate the restaurant twice a week. The food wasn’t even good (this is coming from a costumer that has gone to various locations and have never had a problem for 15+ years). Red lobsters please do better."

The salmon was cooked well and food tasted great but the service needs to change"

The food was very fresh, and the service was excellent. The only issue was that it was a bit cold sitting under the AC, but overall it was a great experience"

It was 2:00pm when I arrived on 7/5/2025. The asparagus was dry and old looking at the tips. The crab top potato's was mushy and had no taste, no flavor. The Margarita  Strawberry drink I ordered was full of sugar and had to be returned to the waiter. The waiter Rushare L was courteous during our dining."

Additionally, I ordered some crab legs to go because my friends meal of crab legs were great (they shared with me)..however when I got home and was putting away the order, I noticed that what I brought home was nothing like what was served in the restaurant!!  The clusters are both so tiny, I'm sure it would never be served in house!! One of the clusters looks to be so old, the shell is gray/black.  Shameful..\nShame on me for trusting and not checking before I left the restaurant.  Definitely not pleased about that."
