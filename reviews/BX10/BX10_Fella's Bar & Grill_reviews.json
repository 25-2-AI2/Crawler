A very cool black dude started serenading a couple of pretty girls next to him, A renown fisherman got up to dance in the bar.... with the serenading black dude.... A white older white bartender.. pouring drinks.. Singing Motown  and keeping the drinks and food flowing. AND THIS WAS A DARK DREARY MONDAY NIGHT. ...  Every person in this bar embraced my wife and I, total strangers... DAMN I love this place..  I can hear the cynical folks out there sayin' \" why you gotta say Puerto Ricans, why you gotta say black, white.. or whatever..  I do that to say.. in this pub.. in city Island NY.. they are all now.. FRIENDS."

            "text": "This review doesn't so much reflect on the establishment itself, but rather on the individual bartender who was extremely rude and offensive to my group.  The dark haired bartender with glasses, I believe her name is Naty was extremely rude to my party of 5.\n\nWe had just came from a close by restaurant and decided to stop in to play pool.  After about 10 minutes of us being in the bar and having already started our game of pool, Naty approached our group in an aggressive and rude manner and told us that the pool table is only for patrons with an attitude.  We were all offended by her rude and condescending tone.  There was no reason for her to approach us the way she did.  We all would have ordered drinks and probably would have start a tab had she not been so rude and obnoxious.\n\nTwo of the people in my party ordered drinks, but the other three of us refused because of her rude and offensive tone.\n\nNaty should not be working in a bar because she does not know how to speak cordially to people.  Even a gentleman who was waiting for his wife to come out of the bathroom told us that Naty is mean.\n\nWhoever the owner or manager is needs to have a serious conversation with Naty because she is costing them business and will continue to adversely affect the atmosphere of the business."
