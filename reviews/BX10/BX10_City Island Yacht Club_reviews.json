But we had the opportunity to drive there, and decided to go to CIYC for dinner. The staff were wonderful and welcoming from the moment we called to make a reservation. One wasn't needed, it turned out, but in booking it, we did secure a table with beautiful views of Pelham Bay, and the city on the horizon. The food was wonderful, and we're happy we ordered the new Mac & Cheese recipe the chef tried. We even learned a little about the local life from our server who was a proud \"clam digger\". The restaurant is open to the public, attire is casual, and parking is available."

Club is very well managed and attentive to club members needs, most of the members are \"old boys\" with years of experience sailing and owning the boats. Dinners after regatas are great, with members commenting on the race and having fun.. Facilities are aged but well maintained and adequate for racers and day racers. Great atmosphere and very friendly club. Great mooring field with easy and protected access. Lots of restaurants on the Island if you need more dining options ( I don't) ,Only complain I haver is commuting from NJ. But I love it.\nThe restaurant is run by hired outside chefs, this year we have excellent one. Any issues with food are addressed right away and corrected. don't blame CIYC for chef having a bad day, if it repeats he will get replaced."
