With a large track and field area that puts Soundview Park's to shame, easy accessibility from the 6 train, free parking, a bunch of pathways to walk along and enjoy the sights (especially now that it's Autumn), a few nice statues to look at, a big playground, a number of different sports courts, and a bunch of areas to sit down and have a barbecue with your family and friends. Great views of the water and city skyline as well, especially a bit closer to nighttime. You can't even see all of the park in one day unless you wanna challenge yourself. Not only that, I felt very safe during my walk through the park, and others that I've encountered have been quite friendly. 10/10 park and highly recommend it."

Two things that should be updated...1. the bathrooms. Right now the door is open and there's a stall right there almost at the door, 2. there are zero food vendors. The only thing there is an ice cream truck who charges $12 for a milk shake. Bring your own lunch."
