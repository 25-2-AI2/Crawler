I waited more than 30 minutes just for an order of fried chicken maybe because City Island is a town and people are layback lol\nBut I cannot imagine if I would've had a large order If you go be willing to wait.\nNote➡️ I ordered the Fried chicken 🍗well done (crispy) because they staple the container plus I didn't check before leaving after I came home, the chicken were flavorless and white up; Not tasty at all.\nI forgot to take a picture!"

Every time I try the chicken chow mein, it feels like snot is rolling over my tongue. It's just not the right consistency.  The chicken tastes sub par and it's barely tender.  The fried rice tastes ok, but the quality is spotty. Sometimes it tastes just fine, other times it tastes like hardened little pieces of rice with no flavor.  The spring rolls have no crunch because the outer casing is spongy with grease and oil.\n\nBleh.  Maybe I should have given this place 1 star."
