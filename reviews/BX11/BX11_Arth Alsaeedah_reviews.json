Their rotisserie chicken is juicy because the size of the chicken they use, some places be using 30lb chicken to “sell” the most meat but here they use maybe 10-15lb chickens making them more tender and juicy 🤤. Their pricing is fair compared to other Yemeni/middle eastern restaurants. This is my go to Yemeni cuisine when I’m in the Bronx,"

One of the employees was wearing very dirty clothes with food and oil stuck on the shirt.\n\n3. The tea machine that serves complimentary tea for customers is a great idea, but again, there is mold smell coming out from the tea. They should clean the machine before serving complimentary tea for customers.\n\n4. They place the uncooked chicken on the floor? I mean, COME ON. You do not ever do that. (Refer to the attached picture)\n\nThis makes me worry even more about how clean the kitchen is from inside.\n\nI will remove this review once the manager/owner responds back to my review and assures us in the response that they will take strict measurements when it comes to hygiene because I don't want to affect their business.\n\nI love this place, but I get disappointed with the hygiene."

STAY AWAY!!!\nthis was one of the worst experience I ever had since years.\nI really don’t know where to start and what to say .\nI will be accurate and subjective.\n\nSanitary : food spells all over the place, on table and floors, never cleaned properly , you can’t even know where to step . Everything very sticky. The so-called salad bar left open and exposed to everyone . The soup pot is dirty and soup spelled all around. The butcher came from inside with his white coat covered by blood to have a break in the dinning area which was very disgusting .\n\nFood quality : Rotisserie chicken was extremely dry and hard like a cardboard, My teeth got hurt from chewing for the rest of the day . It looks like it has been cooked hours ago and lift under the grill( god knows for how long ) . The 1/2 chicken was extremely small and was actually a half chick , which I paid $18 for with rice. Rice was undercooked and chewy.\n\nPrices : very expensive compared to the portion and quality . They raise the prices and reduce the portions with no quality what so ever. Average meal in mid 20’s .\n\nI really feel hurt after that experience , not only because what I have seen , but because from my experience in the Yamani kitchen, it is one of the tastiest food  in the world and this reflects a very bad picture about if .\nI hope this review will guide you in your trip ."
