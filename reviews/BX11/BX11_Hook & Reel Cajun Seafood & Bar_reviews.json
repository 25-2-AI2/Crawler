            "text": "By far my all-time favorite dining experience. The staff are very friendly, and the atmosphere is generally very welcoming; whether you come dining here with others or by yourself. The seafood is top quality, happy hour and DJ nights are a good and fun way to have a bit of fun, and some of the more pricey items are worth the price. I'm also glad they're starting to do dessert items, and hopefully they continue to do so, as that was the main thing this place lacked for me. The only negative I have is that I believe the tin of napkins should already be on the table and you shouldn't have to ask for them (considering how messy some food can get). But besides that, you have to come here when you got the time and money. You won't regret it."

From the moment we were seated, she greeted us warmly and made us feel completely welcome. She was attentive without ever being intrusive, anticipating our needs before we even had to ask.\n\nService like this is rare, and it elevated our entire dining experience. Chayanne went above and beyond, and I would absolutely return to this restaurant knowing that we’d be in such great hands again. Highly recommend asking for her if you visit—you won’t be disappointed!"

At the end the bills were all screwed up. Double orders on different bills. Some people had thier order on 2 or 3 bills. Someone got charged for something they didn't get another ordered pasta and she didn't get it another waited a really long time for just a soda way after she got her food. The bills were a hot mess . The birthday girl was very upset and asked for my help to sort it out. It took me an hour or more to sort the mess out.. I had to have her reprint SEVERAL times. I didn't enjoy myself at all mind you I didn't even eat. I feel the server could've been more helpful in sorting things out instead I did it all and I was highly frustrated. Not a good experience for me at all.i feel that for a large group there should be two servers."

I wish she could have been here in the past. It's okay, she made up for past experiences. Look at the plate in the pic.\n\nUpdate...3/8 against my advice and review my family decided to try this place, my sis never been here so we gave it a shot. My main issue was the waitress had a cold and snot tissue in her hand. I tried to get a pic, but she tossed it by the time she returned to the table. Then she forgot the drinks and an order, no biggie, but the food she gave us was incorrect. We kept it, even paid for it. She said she had adhd...idk what happened, I thought for sure she would be a vibe.\n\n1/20 Got there @ 9:11 and was passed 2x by an Asian girl and overlooked by the girl  sitting beside the door. The Hispanic male also stood there never acknowledging me. Finally I asked @  9:17 how long do I have to wait to be seated? He gon ask the other girl in the corner, i didn't even see her. She gon look at the time and say 9:15. I said I been in here since 9:11 and you (pointing to the Hispanic dude saw me when I walked in. The other girl sitting by the door ran to help the guy that came through the door, only to see he was with me. Her turn of shame was priceless. The girl from the corner proceeded to show me a sign that the last seating was @ 9:15. I said it's cool, but it was very rude and u professional how this all transpired. If I had not asked y'all would not have said nothing. The girl from the corner offered her apologies, but the damage was done. I called on Saturday and spoke to an Asian man I believe. He was so nice and welcoming, to bad the call didn't match the experience. We would have taken the food to go, but that wasn't even offered. It's cool  google says they have another location on 161st street"

I normally go to the one in my neighborhood in Long Island.\n\nI was in the Bronx with my siblings and my brother decided we come here for drinks. We didn't eat anything but the drinks and bartender service were on point! Great customer service. They even would bud into our conversations lol. I hope i get those 2 (male and female Mothers Day) again the next time I go."
