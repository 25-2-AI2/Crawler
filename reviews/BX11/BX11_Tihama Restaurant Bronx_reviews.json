The fresh soft bread is huge and so yummy and only like $3. We got the Mandy Lamb with rice which was excellent, and the hummus. The tea is black and sweet and the music was beautiful! Definitely will return. Definitely recommend. Decent prices too. Oh and the soup and salad were both delish! Like a curry chicken broth and tomatoes, cucumbers, lettuce and a good sauce."
