            "text": "Azal offers a reliable and enjoyable Middle Eastern dining experience, though it doesn't quite rise to the level of truly memorable. Located in a bustling strip mall, the restaurant's unpretentious exterior gives way to a pleasant, moderately-decorated interior. It's a comfortable spot for a weeknight dinner, and while it lacks some of the vibrant atmosphere of other spots, the casual and clean setting is perfectly functional."

            "text": "In all fairness, I appreciate effort and good manners especially in the world we live in today as this is very hard to come by. The servers, I wish I asked their names, were VERY polite and patient with us. I went there with 2 of my sisters and we were very chatty and struggled to get to the menu lol. They did not make us feel rushed in any way. The presentation of the food was very nice. I give 5 stars for this because intention is very valuable.\n\nHowever ☝🏼 please address cleanliness of walls by the booths. My sisters and I joked in regards to not looking and stay focused on eachother and food. Hummus and Naan were absolutely delicious 🤤 the chicken itself on all our platters were sadly tasteless. Still very edible and not deserving of extreme criticism. We left with full bellies.\nThank you for your service and efforts 🙏🏼🤍"

I also had the grilled lamb on pita, which was excellent too. Started things out with their soup, a rich broth that tasted like it simmered for hours and also went great with the rice. Friendly staff and that unbeatable location steps from spots for Adeni chai make Azal an easy favorite."

            "text": "It was a Sunday evening in Little Yemen, the Bronx still buzzing gently with the spirit of Eid. After a community gathering, our group—friends from across the Arabian Peninsula—found our way to Azal Restaurant and Hall. There was something incredibly grounding about walking into a space that felt both familiar and deeply rooted in tradition. It wasn’t just about dinner—it was about reconnecting with home while being far from it.\n\nThe restaurant had a quiet hum to it—families gathered around large tables, laughter rising and falling in the background, and the scent of spiced lamb and bubbling stew drifting from the kitchen. It felt like the kind of place where food isn’t plated—it’s shared. Generous, warm, and unapologetically authentic.\n\nWe started with two childhood classics—Vimto and Shani—iced and sweet, the kind of drinks that immediately take you back. The food came out family-style: a bubbling fahsa stew in its traditional stone pot, rich with flavor and served with hot Yemeni bread perfect for scooping; haneeth lamb over fragrant rice, fall-off-the-bone tender; and zarabyan rice, layered with spice and slow-cooked lamb, slightly bolder and more aromatic.\n\nThe table was completed with fresh salad and a light, warmly spiced soup—a gesture of hospitality we didn’t even need to ask for. Everything felt thoughtful, generous, and made to be shared.\n\nAzal doesn’t try to modernize or reinterpret—it preserves. It serves food like it’s meant to be remembered. For all of us, being from the Arabian Peninsula, this dinner felt like something more than familiar. It felt like home, translated across a few thousand miles.\n\nIn a city full of options, Azal Restaurant and Hall stands out by staying true. If you’re seeking a taste of home, or even just the warmth that comes with it, this is a place to sit, eat, and be reminded."

We ordered the Mix Grill Platter, Lamb Khabsa, and Chicken Biryani — and every dish was full of flavor.\n\nThe meats in the Mix Grill Platter were incredibly juicy and well-seasoned, grilled to perfection. The Lamb Khabsa had a rich, aromatic flavor with tender meat that practically melted in the mouth. The Chicken Biryani was also a standout — fragrant, well-spiced, and generously portioned.\n\nOverall, the food was delicious, and the portions were satisfying. If you’re looking for a spot that serves authentic Middle Eastern flavors with quality meats, Azal is definitely worth checking out."

The staff is super friendly and would take a step ahead to suggest you the best thing on the menu.\n\nThey have small cabins so that you can enjoy with your family in privacy. They give a fresh new white tracing paper over the table which they ensures hygiene at its best. The food comes in really quick once ordered. The soup served as the welcome item is very flavourful and sets your taste buds in the tone for some delicious foods on the way.\n\nI didn't like their desserts though."

Having never experienced Yemeni cuisine before, we were pleasantly surprised by the rich flavors and, above all, the exceptional hospitality we encountered at this hidden gem. The food was authentically prepared and incredibly tasty, and the servers were wonderfully attentive. Despite being the only patrons not from Yemen, we felt completely at home. The staff graciously offered us samples from the menu to help us make informed choices, ensuring we enjoyed our meal. Even my daughter, who is a picky eater, relished everything she tried, much to our delight. The prices were reasonable, and the ambiance was genuinely authentic. We were also pleasantly surprised by the generous portions we received. We will definitely be returning to Azal and highly recommend it to others seeking an authentic Yemeni dining experience."

We finished with tea and Fanta drinks.\n\nThe food is great. The best one is lamb haneeth. Please don't forget to try it.\n\nIn the corner there is a prayer place. Also there are three tables on the right hand side where you can sit with your family privately.\n\nService is very good 😊. They put the tablecloths and help you settle down. They are very polite and helpful.\n\nThere are some slight differences between the menu in the website of the restaurant and the actual physical menu that we received in the restaurant.\n\nPlease see the pictures for the most updated menu as of July 2024."

I finally got one on the street where I had to pay $1.75 for 80 minutes.\n\n2) Restaurant atmosphere and cleanliness: this restaurant is very clean and brings a cultural presence that takes an insight into the old city of Sanna. I felt I was in Yemen. Well done!\n\n3) Greeting and seating: when I entered the restaurant, no one greeted me or helped me finding a seat. The owner should elevate the customer service by hiring at least two people. The waiter was taking orders, cleaning, helping existed customers, and getting the food from the kitchen, poor waiter. I then got a menu and found myself a seat. After 3-4 minutes, the waiter showed up and I waived my hand to let him know that I am ready to order. The waiter was very polite and helpful and helped me select a dish.\n\n4) The menu: it is well presented and easy to follow. I visited the restaurant during breakfast. Thus, I ordered Sackshuka, Yemeni bread, and Adni tea. The food was perfect and reminded me of Mom’s cooking style. Well done.\n\n5) The food took a while to get onto my table, but they seemed short staffed. Therefore, I won’t use this factor in my reviewing process\n\n6) Bill: I paid less than $13 which totally worth the money and the wait.\n\nHopefully, I will try their lunch when I am in town.\n\nI will give this restaurant 5/5 for their breakfast menu."
