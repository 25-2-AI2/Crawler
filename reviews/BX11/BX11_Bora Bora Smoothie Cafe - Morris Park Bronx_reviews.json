From the moment I walked in, I was blown away by the sweet aromas and the vibrant, welcoming atmosphere. But let me get straight to the point: the waffles are hands down the best I’ve ever had.\n\nGolden, crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside, and topped with just the right amount of syrup, fruit, or chocolate—whatever your heart desires. It’s not just a waffle; it’s an experience. Every bite feels like pure happiness.\n\nThe rest of the menu? Also amazing. From gourmet pastries to creative dessert platters and specialty drinks, there’s something for every kind of sweet tooth. You can tell everything is made with care and creativity.\n\nIf you’re in town or even thinking about where to go next, do yourself a favor and come to Bora Bora. Whether you’re a foodie or just someone who enjoys a really good treat, this place will blow your mind. Trust me—you haven’t truly lived until you’ve tried their waffles."

The coconut base has a great texture & flavor & the fruit and Nutella really made for a delicious combination. I’ll definitely try more bowls from them soon! Also, I went bank the next day and tried the coffee. I had a large iced coffee with oat milk. I was going to go back and ask for more oat milk, but actually ended up drinking it dark because the flavor was so rich and bold. Great coffee!! You don’t even need much else in it! Also, the staff was very friendly & helpful 😊"

They offered free drinks, smoothies and food during their grand opening day and it took about 5 mins to receive the goodies. Shoutout to all the workers who helped contribute to a successful opening and making sure the customers left satisfied. The opening attracted a large crowd ranging from babies to elders and with all the anticipated traffic, they made sure everyone was served and satisfied. Thank-you for bringing Bora Bora to the Bronx and looking forward to more business owners opening businesses in the Bronx."

Their açaí bowls are amazing. I had the Boratella bowl, which has a few of my favorites: granola, peanut butter, banana, strawberry and nutella with little cocoa nibs. That’s actually my favorite so if you’re having a hard time choosing which one, pick that one! The pricing here is very fair. The decor is beautiful from the floors to the ceiling. I love their teal couches and the lamps that hang. And can’t forget the grass on the ceiling! With the yellow flowers. I will definitely come back and recommend anyone I know to this location! The staff were really pleasant and very attentive. You walk in and leave feeling like a valued customer! This place is nothing short of a 5 star review!"
