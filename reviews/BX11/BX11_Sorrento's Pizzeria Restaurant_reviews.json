The cheese pizza slice is huge and steaming hot. I love Sorrento’s regular thin crust pizza that stays crunchy until the last bite.\nI tried a slice of the Sicilian per other reviews; I did not enjoy it as much as the traditional plain pizza. It must be my taste buds, and I did not let it affect my experience at this place.\nI concur with other reviews that the people at this place are very friendly. Service was quick, and help were plentiful.\nWill I return to this place? I will."
