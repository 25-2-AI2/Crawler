Every pizza I tried till this point has been subpar. My family was visiting from Michigan and they wanted to try an authentic new york pizza and my Google search led me to this pizzeria. The pizza was incredible and Luigi was an amazing host. It felt like I was having some food at my grandpa's house. After we finished eating, he gave us some sweets and gave the kids some lollipops. Overall, I'm extremely happy that fate brought me to his shop and now I'm looking forward to my next visit."

The employees are absolutely professional and courteous. I highly... Matter of fact. I implore you to order from primevera. They haven't disappointed as of far. As compared to Portnoys reviews of \"Johnny's\"... Absolutely horrid pizza after gaining attention and rated in 9 out of ten.
