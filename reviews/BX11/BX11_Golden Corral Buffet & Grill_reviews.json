My favorite is the yeast rolls and the banana bread pudding with vanilla ice cream! The food was hot and constantly being refilled. Last time I was here was for a work meeting in the private room and they did not disappoint.  Thank you Orlando and the rest of the GC crew!!!"

From the moment I walked in, everything felt welcoming, but what really made it special was my server, Georgina. She went above and beyond she was sweet, patient, and very attentive. She never made me feel rushed, always checked in with a smile, and truly took her time to make sure I had everything I needed. Good customer service is hard to come by these days, but Georgina made my visit memorable. If anyone decides to eat here, I highly recommend asking for Georgina you won’t be disappointed!"

Service at the table was very quick.\nThe food was better than you'd expect from a buffet. Not every item was a hit, but a few of the dishes were actually pretty great. They had a homecooked feel. The Pot Roast was amazing, as well as the pulled pork and ribs. The bourbon chicken tasted like cheap teriyaki. The salad bar was neat and well stocked and the desserts were charming. Would recommend for a cheap way to fill up with a big meal when you don't quite know what to choose. Our server, Angel, was very attentive and quick. He made sure we had everything we needed."

We received good service. I enjoyed the food. The money was worth the admission price. This is a great spot to hang out with friends or family and grab a quick bite or dinner, and I highly recommend it. The customer service provided by Chasity was exceptional and she was very attentive."
