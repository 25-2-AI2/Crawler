The seafood was unbelievably fresh — the grilled shrimp and lobster were perfectly cooked, tender, and full of flavor. The staff were friendly and attentive without being intrusive, and the place had a cozy, coastal vibe that made the whole evening feel special. You can really tell they care about quality and presentation. Definitely one of the best seafood spots I’ve been to — can’t wait to come back!"

The fish was tender and juicy, and the sauces had that perfect balance of spice and depth.\nMust try the salta with shrimp and fish.\nAnd sea food soup\nService was friendly and quick, and the place had a clean, welcoming atmosphere.\nHighly recommend the grilled fish — both were outstanding! Definitely one of the best seafood spots around."
