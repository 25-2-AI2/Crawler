They just don’t seem like bar people lol. I honestly wonder how some bars hire bartenders. They usually have such good vibes and set the mood. But yeah, no, this place ain’t it. don’t come here to feel welcomed by the workers🙄just come here for cheap drinks and the bar folks."

The patrons seemed like usuals which were a good vibe as well. My server Stef was amazing and made me feel comfortable once i settled in a nice cozy booth. The burger was exquisite and exactly to my liking. I had a medium rare angus beef burger with cheddar; topped with sautéed onions, bacon, lettuce, and tomato; as well as a side of sweet potato fries. I will definitely be back to try the MPI burger i believe it was called which is a bigger burger than what i had order. Thank you guys !!"

Christine was our bartender for the beginning of our shift and she was absolutely amazing, I ordered the Mediterranean Salad with Shrimp and it was honestly pretty amazing. The shrimp were grilled, but actually grilled. There was a nice charred crust on them. My friend had lemon pepper wings and Fish tacos which she loved as well. If you're watching your waistline ask for the dressing on the side 😉. It was really really good and hard to resist. Drinks were great ! Karaoke was fun. Jasmine was our bartender for the 2nd half of our shift and she was just as amazing with her drink recommendations. Neighborhood bars don't always get enough credit, give them a try you will not be disappointed."
