The waiter’s behavior was extremely rude and unprofessional, which completely ruined the visit. Instead of being welcoming and attentive, the staff acted as if they were doing us a favor by serving.\nGood food and service should go hand in hand, and no matter how decent the food might be, bad behavior from staff leaves a lasting negative impression. I genuinely hope the management looks into this and trains their staff to treat customers with basic respect and courtesy.\nWould not recommend until service improves.\n\nزرت مطعم شاورما موكّي مؤخرًا، وللأسف كانت التجربة غير مُرضية إطلاقًا. تصرف النادل كان سيئًا وغير محترف، مما أفسد الزيارة تمامًا. بدلًا من أن يكون مرحبًا ومتعاونًا، تصرّف وكأنّه يُقدّم خدمة مجاملة وليس عملًا.يجب أن يجتمع الطعام الجيد مع الخدمة الجيدة، ومهما كان الطعام لذيذًا، فإن سوء معاملة الزبائن يترك انطباعًا سلبيًا لا يُنسى. أتمنى بصدق أن تُراجع الإدارة هذا الأمر وتُدرّب الموظفين على التعامل باحترام وأدب مع الزبائن.\nلا أنصح بزيارة المطعم حتى تتحسّن الخدمة."

Chicken was overcooked completely bone dry. The sandwich only had chicken, very little bit of sauce and some fries. It was missing all the other ingredients. Complete disappointment. On top of that I ordered hummus and asked if it comes with bread and was only given one small round piece of bread. Not enough for the tub of hummus that I ordered. I doubt I'll be ordering again from here."

The sandwich itself was slightly dry, and the chicken seasoning wasn’t the typical flavor we’re accustomed to in shawarma. On a positive note, the dip sauce was tasty, but the portion was too small. I recommend revisiting the chicken seasoning, adjusting the pricing, and increasing the dip portion size."

            "text": "Shawarma mocci is a good place, but needs to make some real changes if it wants to sustain itself.\n\nFirst off the pricing. It is very expensive compared to its local counterparts. Shawarma platter starts minimum $20. That’s quite expensive, especially if you compare to places that have built the reputation in cities like Queens.\n\nSecondly, being mindful of their menu items and portions. Their menu states that platters should get hummus pickles and fries. Yet 90% of the time that I have ordered, they missed the fries. The portions of the meat is also significantly small. if I am paying $20 for a platter, I am fully expecting everything to be included and that the portion size of the meat match the cost.\n\nIn terms of flavor, this place is good. Others may have complained about the meat too dry, but I have not experienced that.\n\nOverall, this is a decent place with lots of potential . I truly believe if they reduce the price by a couple of dollars they will not only see more people coming through the door. They should also make sure that the employees understand what’s on the menu. If something says fries is included then they should definitely be including it, especially if they’re going to charge so much money."
