I had the oxtail empanada and I ask the server to give me the next best and he gave me the ackee and saltfish empanada, he didn't make a mistake. Omg they are so scrumptious. Well seasoned and all. Love it and I would definitely recommend D'melting pot after trying for the first time. Finger licking good."

Some of the oxtails were also a bit rough. The portion of food was very filling 💯 It tasted as if there was molasses in there but not enough. I would like to give this establishment another try but I'd rather just save my money & make my own next time or go all the way to Brooklyn to order from Footprints. The oxtail empanadas were really good. 👌\n\nI gave 3 stars because I was disappointed 😞 😔"

I got the oxtail empanadas which were juicy not dry in anyway and the jerk chicken with rice and peas. The sauces that came with the empanada ,and I think the chicken, were so good as well which paired excellently, I only wish I had more chicken, but not because of the portion size, but because of how good it was.

I’ve been looking for a good Caribbean restaurant for a while now and I just found my new go to spot. I recommend this spot to anyone! The food here is spectacular! They have some of the best oxtail I have ever had. The oxtail empanadas are a must try, it is so tender and jam packed with flavor. Their callaloo and saltfish is great too. On top of that we also got the shrimp Mac and cheese, and that was pretty delicious as well - very moist and flavorful!\n\nI live in queens but I will gladly travel here any day for this amazing food. On top of that, we got to meet Orain and Angela and they were so nice and personable. We had such a genuine conversation and looking forward to another interaction with them just made it more of a no brainer to come back!"
