            "text": "After reading the reviews here, I went to this place to eat. People said the food was good. Let's start with the food: I ordered lamb roast, and it was served on a worn out plate wrapped in aluminum foil :O :O The server just left it there as if whatever. That plate seems to have been in use for decades!!! WOW!!! I felt hurt seeing the aluminum foil as how toxic foods I must be eating here with the money I am spending. There were two slices of lamb and a slice of lamb rib. The meat was soft but the smell was bad. I held my breath as I ate it. I also mixed the lamb with sauce to forget its smell. Because it was cooked too long, the taste of the meat was gone, practically.\n\nI asked to replace the rice with naan. So, the Naab braed was partially burnt as you can see in the picture too. They were hot and tasted good. The naan tasted good, in fact that's the only thing that tasted good.\n\nThe soup was blend, I added the sauce in it to make it taste better. The salad was worn out and old. When did they get those salad supplies :'( I felt sad and hurt inside as I ate.\n\nI came hungry and ate everything with the naan and sauce.\n\nThe salad bowl was so worn out, must be decades that they have been using it.\n\nI could not believe that they served me on a broken tray!!! Broken!!!! WOW!!!\n\nThis dish I ordered cost $25 dollars.\n\nThe napkin caddy on the table was so dirty :'( the salt and pepper shakers were also worn out and dirty. You can see files of dust turned black everywhere.\n\nThe service was mundane, they just left things as if whatever!!!\n\nYou have to buy the water bottles as they do not serve water.\n\nthe appearance was ok with bright images that are dust covered.\n\nI regret I went there and spent $27+ dollars.\n\nI don't know how does this place runs like this ...\n\nSPEND a few dollars to renew your plates, trays, and bowls. HOW POOR to be using these worn out and broken items to serve your guests!!! This is just awful.\n\nalhamdulillah."

The service was exceptional, with friendly and attentive staff who made sure every need was met.\n\nBut the real star of the show was the food - oh, the food! Every dish we ordered was a flavor explosion that left us wanting more. The saltah, the kebabs, the mandi... everything was cooked to perfection and presented with love.\n\nIf you're a fan of Yemeni cuisine or just looking to try something new, Arth Aljanathain is a must-visit destination. Trust me, you won't be disappointed"

            "text": "We asked for takeout for lunch. Attention was fast and efficient. We ordered the lamb over rice, their oven vegetables with lamb, their fahsah with meat, and kabseh with meat. The dishes were all delicious - we particularly loved the super tender lamb, which falls off the bone very easily. Their oven veggies are super tasty, and their fahsah was something unique and delicious. Their fahsah and oven vegetables come with bread, while their kabseh is rice-based so no bread included. All of their Yemeni dishes come with curry soup (very delicious) and salad, along with their mildly spicy sauce. Their portion sizes are great, very fulfilling.\n\nI'm definitely ordering from these guys again! Need to try their chicken next time - I saw their chickens, golden delicious, roasting in their kitchen behind the counter. Highly recommended for some Yemeni food in Morris Park area."
