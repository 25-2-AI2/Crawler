            "text": "I’ve been craving good Mexican food for ages. This did not disappoint! The flavour is insane. The Quesabrilla are stuffed full. Double wrapped. The consume is delicious. Lick the bowl clean good. Tepache was perfectly fermented. I’m in town to see a few games at yankee stadium upcoming this weekend and happy to pass the food truck when I do. I will definitely be stopping by again! Good value for the food! Just noting I did get the Tepache with the food. And I did get extra lime, cilantro, and onions. I wasn’t expecting them to be as stuffed as they were lol. Definitely wasn’t required, but it didn’t go to waste!"
