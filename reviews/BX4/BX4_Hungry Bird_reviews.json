I’m a HUGE fan of the lamb biryani and I’ve eaten more of your samosas than I care to admit.\n\nThat said, the last two times I’ve ordered it feels like there’s been a change in the quality — especially noticeable in the naan. Both times the naan has had several raw spots that are still dough.  My husband also mentioned his last order had way less flavor than normal.\n\nThis is a great place and I appreciate it a lot, but I just wanted to share my past two experiences."
