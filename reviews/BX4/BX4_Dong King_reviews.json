It can be a bit difficult to order custom orders since only the son speaks English well enough to understand what you want quickly. The parent's which are the regular workforce understand the orders on their menu, but have trouble understanding anything that strides a little from the norm. Fair price on their meals for today's economy and the food is rather delicious as far as take out restaurant's go.\n\nI recommend the Happy Family, it may be a tad overpriced and drowned in sauce, but only someone who cares deeply for presentation and proper sauce portions would complain. For the rest of us, not practicing our culinary arts on take-out restaurants and being pretentious snobs, it's rather delicious!"
