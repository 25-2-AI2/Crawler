You can really tell they care about the customers.\n\nThis is definitely the place to go if you’re craving amazing food at an affordable price.

            "text": "When this location first opened, service and food quality were great. Unfortunately, that has changed. I request fresh fries every time I visit or call in an order—and almost every time, I’m given old, soggy fries that were clearly sitting in a warmer. I always return the plate and ask for fresh fries, and I’m repeatedly told they are “fresh,” when they are not.\n\nMost recently, I asked an employee to feel the fries himself, and he agreed they weren’t fresh. I was issued a refund—but this has become a regular issue. One employee in particular (glasses, long hair) has been consistently rude and combative when I’ve simply asked for my food to be made the way I request. This is unacceptable behavior from staff, especially when the issue is on their end.\n\nOther locations across New Jersey get it right with no problem. I’m not looking for compensation—I just want my food made correctly the first time. A couple of staff members here have handled things professionally, but the recurring poor service and refusal to prepare food properly shows a clear lack of quality control and staff training at this location.\n\nUntil management addresses these issues, I can’t recommend this location."

Chicken I got was  super crispy, the flavor was good nothing compared to like Dominican crispy fried chicken, it's more unique but still delicious with the white sauce, it's so good. The fries were right on point. It's also served with bread."

And through Google search we discovered this location..Blazin Chicken & Gyro, their classic chicken over rice hit the spot!! The plate was substantial, the pics shows how much food we were given. The chicken was very moist and flavorful. The rice was perfectly cooked, light & fluffy, not hard or dry, and seasoned which is very important(most places give you a bland cooked rice and shower it with sauce),and with the right amount of sauce made this plate very enjoyable to the pallet. The veggies were bright and crisp, the pita bread was light, soft and very tasty on it's own. And lastly the price wasn't exaggerated.(I've paid more for worst and less food). I'd highly recommend this location for great food, friendly service and decent pricing. Thank you Blazin Chicken & Gyro for having great food in the neighborhood!"

It made me VERY VERY VERY SICK!\nI also got a chance to see how they keep the food in back and I noticed they use the same utensils for different things without properly washing it to prevent cross contamination! Don’t eat here, you’ll stomach will get sick. And when I complaint to the owner he didn’t even care to refund me my money or anything!\n\n⬇️⬇️This is how my food was served ⬇️⬇️"
