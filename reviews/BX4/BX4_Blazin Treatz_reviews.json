Chocolate for the strawberries is a bit watered down, but if you let it harden a bit, it tastes much more chocolaty and creamy. However, the strawberries are somewhat expensive (more expensive than most of the other chocolate covered strawberry spots) for the amount given and some of the workers barely give you any chocolate. Paid for extra chocolate for my strawberries, and it was barely able to cover half of the strawberries in the cup. The whole top layer of strawberries barely had a drizzle of chocolate. Some days though they put a decent amount of chocolate. I wonder how much they would put on the strawberries if I didn’t pay for extra chocolate. So I’d give a 2/5 price wise. Location is a 5/5 though."
