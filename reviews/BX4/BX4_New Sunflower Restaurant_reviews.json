The portion are small the dumplings and wontons taste spoiled.\nBut to fast forward I think the only thing that taste good is the usual order Chicken wings with French fries.\nIm 48 now this is the only surviving place and restaurant that is still standing but how the food is now......no comment on that part I hope there approved because this place is part of my childhood."

Although I no longer work in the area, I will travel from a distant area in the Bronx to this restaurant.   I have never eaten from this restaurant & gotten an upset stomach.   The Chinese Restaurants in the area where I live, I have gotten an upset stomach from eating from them.  Once is enough, I don't go to the ones in my neighborhood, period.  So if you are in the area of Yankee Stadium,  it is 1 block east of them on Gerard Avenue.  👍"
