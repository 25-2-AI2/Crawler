            "text": "We had a good time after work.  We came for drinks and wings. The beef and shrimp empanadas were very tasty.  It was just us two. Maybe we came on the wrong day but had a good time anyway. The passion fruit margarita's were good, but the glasses could be a little bigger.  The mango margarita's were good too. They wings were tasty also.. you get 5 to 6 pieces of party wings. We had the sweet chili.  This is a little gem. People shouldn't sleep....it's in the cut, but right in your face also. This will be one of our regulars, but please change the glasses to something bigger, and they were $6 and $5 shots. I'm trying to be the 1st to  add a business to Yelp review for GenerationsLounge, but it's just not working out.  I recommend Generations Lounge Restaurant & Bar for after a long day at work, drink, and wings.  It's very pocket friendly."
