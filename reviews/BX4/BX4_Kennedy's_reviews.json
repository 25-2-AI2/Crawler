After a long day at work, I stopped by (first time) and I ordered a fried chicken and fries combo, hoping for a satisfying meal. Unfortunately, the fries were cold and tough—almost like they’d been sitting around for days. The chicken also tasted stale and unappetizing. I was so disappointed I ended up throwing the entire combo away. I’ve been to other Kennedy’s before but this was really bad."
