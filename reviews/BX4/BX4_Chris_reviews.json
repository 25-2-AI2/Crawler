I plan to come back regularly for the mac and cheese and pernil especially.\n\nAnd it's very sanitary, they require you to wear gloves when serving yourself from their buffet, which is a move very few businesses make,  and I greatly appreciate.\n\nI'd also like to note that I'm a very picky eater and have very high standards for food quality, because I was raised by a fantastic chef. I am very rarely so excited by eateries, even the very well reviewed ones, I'm often dissapointed and left wanting.\n\nIf you're in the area, stop over for a very well priced meal, especially for the quality.\n\nIt's a locally owned small business with good service and fantastic food, sanitary, fresh, good prices, there's nothing more you could ask for.\n\nI would reccomend it to literally anyone."
