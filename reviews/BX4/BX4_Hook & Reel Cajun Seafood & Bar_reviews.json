The service was a bit slow at first, I think the waitress was double / triple seated but we didn't wait too long. we got the garlic and cajun steam pots, they were delicious, one of the most satisfying meals I've ever had. Our server was friendly, chatty and efficient. Definitely go back."

The shell was so hard to open and the meat wasn't edible I couldn't even chew it. I asked for it to be remade and the second time was the same thing. My step father tried to show the owner how na crab is supposed to look and taste but the own still made us pay $40 even though I didn't get to eat any of the crab. The waitress was amazing and tried her best to handled the situation so kudos to her. I always come back for the food tho just never get the king crab from here"

It’s was still piping hot, and very very undercooked,  pure pink in the middle… I then immediately contacted uber support, to report the food safety issue. I take Immuno suppressant because of a health condition and cannot eat anything raw. My stomach felt queasy and then I begin to vomit. Next, I decided to call the restaurant. The manager thought I wanted to place an order, so before asking me, She passed the phone. This staff member She did look up my order and tells me that I have to call Uber. They’ll give me the money back.  It’s not about money. I could’ve been hospitalized for weeks or worst.  I just wanted reassurance that the cook would know about his mistake and either get extra training or get help during crowded time. So he can check and double check to make sure all the food is probably prepared before sending her off to your customers, She did apologize several times and said that it will be handled. I’m going to post this here and on every social media outlet that I have and I will be sending it to my entire family that’s been living in this area for over 50 years. Unfortunately, hooking reel has lost a customer"

            "text": "I've visited this restaurant at 236 East 161 street in the Bronx because my sons really enjoy the food. We were turned away the first night because we arrived a little after 9pm and was told the kitchen was closed but the restaurant doesn't close until 10pm. So, we returned the next day to dine-in. All was well with the WHITE server until he learned that I was not going to leave a tip. The manager, a young Asian looking boy began questioning me and stating that the next time the server will refuse to serve me and that I shouldn't come back. I recorded him and informed him that I would sue for discrimination if I was treated that way. I then explained that tiping is my personal choice for exceptional service, at which I did not receive. After, the server and the manager became very rude and disrespectful ( I guess at this point, it was no need to mask their racism) The server refused to process my payment and asked another server to assist me. The server expressed he could not because he had his own customers he was seating at the time. The server proceeded to shove his probable payment processing device in my hand for me to process on my own. When I asked for a receipt, I was told to wait because he was busy. I then sought the help of the manger who also said I needed to wait. He then began cursing at me in front of my children. Im glad this happened because it shows their not interested in providing a service, their only tip chasing. Their true feelings about serving a Black woman came. Im never returning. If you don't RESPECT me then don't EXPECT my money. I wouldn't advise any of my people to go here. Their located in the mall on 161. There are many other seafood restaurants like Cap't Loui that value and treat their customers with respect. To the owner, save the apology because you know exactly how your establishment is being run. You're enabling it. Im sure I'm not the first person to be treated like that."

This was no ordinary restaurant. I went in and was greeted by the hostess, who showed me options to dine for the day. I ordered a delicious 1/2 pound of Lemon Pepper Shrimp, loaded with Potatoes and Corn. It was savory to my palette. And the restaurant itself was decorated with wall designs with a chill oak wood interior. The waiters had asked how I was doing while I enjoyed my time. Thank you Hook & Reel!"

I was surprised by the excellent customer service given from the moment we stepped into the door to the very moment we left. First of all, the waitress at the front greeted us with a genuine smile. (Not typical behavior from businesses in the Bronx,) She gave us a booth within a few minutes, wasn't a long wait. Not too long after, our assigned waiter came to our table and introduced himself. My daughter is very shy and quiet, so she's not good with talking to strangers. I'm sure he picked up on that and was very friendly, making her and myself feel comfortable. The whole time in between, he came to our table to check in on us. He was very patient, sweet, knowledgable on the menu and his vibes were definitely genuine. At the end, I gave him a tip but that wasn't good enough. I had to give this young man a good review online. The name on his tag is Kyle.\n\nAs for the food and drinks, it was good. The chicken was a bit salty, but it was also crispy so that made up for it. I didn't try their seafood so I can't rate that, (wasnt in the mood for it this day) Pricing was a bit high, but the positive environment the employees set for this place makes it worth it. In total, I will go to this place again, for sure. Good job to the owner of this restaurant for hiring a team of great people. THAT is what keeps customers like me coming back in the future, giving good tips AND bringing more customers for you by giving positive recommendations about your business. I'll definitely come back next time and try the seafood!"

It is just mind bottling.\n\nI went here since at jury duty,  and was the only one in the restaurant.  They had a lunch special for $10.99 with fries and can’t remember if it included a drink. It felt like it was included but I got charged separately for it,  see picture in bill.\n\nThe Cajun fries were only half Cajun,  the other half tasted like Chemicals.\n\nI got the first bill and it was $27.  I tell the waitress I had the special,  and she apologizes and takes about 5 minutes to correct after speaking to manager.\n\nI get final bill in the picture,  and I just wanted to get out at this time.  As I’m putting the cash down, I get this feeling the waitress wants more tips.  I gave her $22 on the bill of $17.33.  She felt not too happy.\n\nAs I start walking out of the restaurant, I take a closer look at the bill,  and they had charged a 15% gratuity for sitting inside….\n\nFelt deceived and the food was mediocre at best,  and can easily say this is the first and last time I’m going to this chain."

I walked in & I think Annie was having dinner at the checkout counter..The younglady who was tending to my side of the room was moving g as fast as she could. not crowded but as I sat during lunch it started to build with customers. I played it safe & ordered the $10.99 lunch special of jumbo shrimps which lived up to its name. They were tender & large with sweet potatoes fries. Enjoyed my visit hopefully will return soon & try something else."
