The server was very nice she told me I still had about 45 minutes which was okay with me but as I’m looking through the menu I heard the workers in the back talking about they are cleaning and they are closing so it made me feel uncomfortable even ordering…. If the time for closing is 9 and they’re still serving why are the workers in the back complaining?…. Overall the food is good here."

I guess I keep going back because it's the only place near me that sometimes has a decent nice size corned beef sandwich, but for $18.50 make that $21 with tax it should be good every time and right near the courthouse you would think it would be better. I also think it depends on the person making the sandwich because sometimes it's a nice size and then there are days like this one when you say to yourself for $21 it should be bigger and better but I guess not many people order corned beef I can't say I won't go back again because I'm going to figure out the day of the week that I should go when it will be at its best because I do not like brown corned beef like I said  I was not happy"
