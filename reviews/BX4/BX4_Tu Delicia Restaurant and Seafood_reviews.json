The food was pretty good. We ordered the #2 combo and some pork chops. The sizes are pretty big and that fed four people with leftovers.\n\nHowever the pork chops came with a side salad that was not very fresh. It smelled pretty bad so no one ate it. At the end of the dinner tho, I did find a bug in it so that's nice... horrible sanitation and food safety back there I guess.\n\nThe combo was good tho, it came with a big container of rice and beans as well as sweet plantains. The chicken was fried but more fried like small chicken tenders with batter than chicharron de pollo.\n\nOverall, good food and decent prices but I won't be back."
