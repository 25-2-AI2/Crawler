            "text": "Went here for a quick bite to eat for lunch. I ordered what I wanted over the phone. The menu prices are out dated but I've added a picture of the new menu and prices. Not much of a difference but its good to know what you are getting and how much it actually is.  The place ia small. And I dont say that as being a bad thing, just giving a description of the location. It's more a to go spot. No seating.  Looks like they are really busy so it made it that much better that I ordered on the phone. They said 15-20 minutes and It was ready when I got there! Okay so i had the tots, they were okay. Didn't taste greasy at all and they gave alot. 2 ppl can probably share depending on how hungry you are. I also tried the steak egg roll. I will start by saying I do not usually eat or like Chinese egg rolls.  However because these were steak ones I wanted to try them. It was pleasantly good! They had a different flavor then I've ever had but it was good! Now on to the reason I want to try thia place.  The steak sandwich!! It was really good! Plenty of meat, cheesy and the bread was nice and soft.its a nice spot to try in the bx. I would try it again."

I was upset because the prices on the menu above my head did not match the prices of the physical menu. $5.00 for half and half was crazy and it was extremely sweet. I tried the Philly and chicken egg roll , one of each. Extremely small egg roll for $5.00 , smaller than the Chinese egg roll. Pairing the egg roll with chili sauce is diabolical . They have to do better. Fight broke out while I was waiting for my food , highly recommend going daylight hours, cause it’s definitely in the hood with no parking. Customer service was giving very much 2025. Cashier, FaceTiming while making orders and the two Mexican men in the back were in a conversation, while we all wait. I’ve had better in New Jersey from a food truck. Local would be nice  , but this ain’t it. I will rather pay the toll and gas for Jersey"

Went there with my people yesterday, had the 10inch Supreme Style Steak sandwich with Parmesan Garlic fries and tried one of the chicken steak eggroll’s and lemonade, All I have to say is IYKYK. Absolutely 🔥 🔥 🔥 they put thought into everything. Food is delicious and has that flavor and kick. Even the toppings are marinated. My boys both had regular philly’s as well and were all hyped after just their first bite. Thanks for the excellent service and food we will be coming back 200% to try everything else on the menu lol."
