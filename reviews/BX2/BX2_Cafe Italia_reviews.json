Bold rich and full of flavor.\n\nReally feeling the coppa dolce too sweet, tender, and melts in your mouth. And the prosciutto di Parma is next level thin, salty, buttery just classic Italian done right."

The sandwiches are delicious and there is a good variety too. You can also customize. The place is clean, has chill music, and the best staff. I like that there are tables to sit and enjoy your meal. I also like that they have freshly squeezed natural orange juice. It has authentic Italian ingredients and the Biscotti tastes like it was made by Nonna. Definitely recommend."
