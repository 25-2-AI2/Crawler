I tried their fried wontons with cheese in which I thought were crab Rangoon’s because when I asked if it was the same, they said yes and sadly it wasn’t! If you want fried cheese then okay but I was expecting cream cheese and sadly it wasn’t. Their fried dumplings with pork are pretty good and really fulfilling as well! None the less this will always be my go to Chinese food restaurant in Hunts Point."
