            "text": "Overall, Sugar is a beautiful venue that delivers on atmosphere and drinks, but has major inconsistencies with service and food quality.\n​A Vibe, Strong Drinks, and Hookah\n​The aesthetics are a pleasure to view; the place is designed beautifully, making it a great spot for a night out. The music was good, contributing to the high-energy vibe. I also appreciate that the drinks are strong—they definitely don't skimp on the liquor here! The hookah was nice as well and a great addition to the evening.\n​Service and Food Missed the Mark\n​The rest of the experience, unfortunately, was a letdown. Our waitress forgot about our table several times, which led to frustratingly long waits. On the food side, the chicken was dry, and the highly anticipated tres leches was a huge disappointment. It didn't taste like tres leches at all; it was more like soggy cornbread.\n​Bottom line: Come here for the great atmosphere and powerful drinks, but lower your expectations for the food and be prepared for potentially slow service."

            "text": "If you are bored and want to grab something to eat locally, this is a decent spot as long as you manage your expectation accordingly.\n\nMy guys took me out for dinner on a Saturday evening a couple months ago. I didn’t want to go too far so I elected for us to try Sugar. A reservation was made however, it wasn’t clear that it was needed. We were seated quickly before the hostess realized we had one and then moved us.\n\nHere is where you must mange expectations, service was extremely slow. Even though our server was sweet, she seemed to be totally out of her element and this definitely hindered the experience. I don’t know if it was age (she appeared to be older than the others), a language barrier (English was not her first language), or unfamiliarity with the menu and/or equipment. It could have been any combination of all of the above. We literally entered our own orders into her handheld a couple of times.\n\nThe table next to us was seated after us, order and received their food & drinks (a couple of rounds) and was done and we were still waiting for our orders to be entered correctly.\n\nI kept it simple with a Jack and Ginger ale, she wasn’t sure if they carried Jack. Thankfully they did, they seem to focus on pre-made frozen drinks and none of those appealed to me.\n\nWe order wings, and I must admit the wings were a bomb 10/10. Seasoned well, crispy, yet juicy and cooked to perfection. I did the stuffed red snapper and the guys both did chicken breast one with white rice and the other with a house salad. The guys enjoyed the chicken breast and while I enjoyed the stuff part of my snapper the fish itself was a little dry and in much need of a sauce since it also lacked flavor. I requested a chimichurri-ish sauce to help carry the dish.\n\nAs you enter the front is a little misleading as it seems to be the staff chill spot, but once you go up the stairs, the main dining area was cool with cute lighting and decent tunes playing.\n\nOverall a decent local spot.\n\nJust A Note:\n\nI would return on a chill night, when again I don’t want to go too far and probably just do the wings and a drink."

Sugar has the potential to be great if they are aware of their demographics and maintain inclusitivity. The manager decided to mix business with pleasure this Saturday and that was all wrong. Nepotism/ discrimination at its finest.  You dont host your personal party and infringe on paying customers, that is not fair.  The music was played like name that tune, you only heard a snippet of music if it was not Spanish. If you wanted to cater to you and your guest shut the place down for the day. The waiter was nice though he messed up awfully due to the chaos of the owners party. The food could have been better.  Came for the patron tower lmao there's only one for the entire establishment.  We waited hours for the manager to release it to no avail.  The only MVP was the bartender she's a doll."

The manager had to keep coming over to help out. You can see the other table he was waiting next to us was quite frustrated too. Food took a while for food to come out. Food looked and smelled great but all the meats were dry. Steak, ribs, chicken, brisket… Flavor wasn’t there too. Also surprised that the salad doesn’t come with a dressing and they charged us for a tiny amount of dressing which we didn’t know about. Gave us wrong check also. Lot of waiting around. Restaurant also already charged us tip and then ask for more tip. Be aware of that. Was quite disappointed with this place."

            "text": "If I could give this place 10 stars, I would. Our first time here was so wonderful, from the ambiance to the service to the food. The whole place has a vibe that was so desperately needed in this area of the Bronx. Our server Jackie was absolutely wonderful, caring without being overbearing, offering us samples of different things to try, was communicative and engaging, and totally sweet. The food was amazing, from the meatball and calamari starters to the pasta mains. Everything was so fresh and well prepared. Then desert which I'm usually not a huge fan of (I decided to just go for it) a Caramel flan with some coconut...stunning. After dinner, the manager Christian came over and spoke with us a bit. We never felt rushed or pressured. He even gave us two shots on the house.  This is a wonderful place, we give and wish for nothing but blessings for the establishment and its staff and will most definitely be back. ~ with utmost respect ~Jan and Jay."

I want to thank all the service staff for the detail and attention given to your customers.  The food is very delicious and flavorful.  Jackie was our server tonight.  Jackie was professional,  friendly, attentive, flexible, and accommodating.  My partner and I ordered two different pasta dishes that were absolutely delicious.   The only thing missing was buttery garlic bread to compliment the pasta dish.  Let's not Christian, the manager.  Wow.  It was unexpected for the manager to come to our table to greet us, to say hello and inquire about our feedback.  He is so pleasant, amicable, charismatic, and has a very lovely charm.  SUGAR Smoked BBQ......... welcome to our community!!!!!!!!  May God bless this amazing establishment in our Bronx neighborhood/community to prosper and blossom.   May this establishment  be blessed with the highest success for many, many years to come. Continue to be great and offer excellent food and service to the community.   We will be back again, again and again."

I would  have give five stars, but for one thing. The gratuity is included. That is fine. Too many people don't tip. However. Once you pay, they give you a blank to sign with a space and suggestions for an additional tip. They didn't return the original bill which showed the gratuity included. I didn't like that."

The pina coladas are delicious as well, and I am definitely looking forward to trying other drinks on the menu. I was able to get a picture of my T-bone steak and my friends NY strip. Both tasted amazing. I’m definitely coming back and would 100% recommend for you to try."
