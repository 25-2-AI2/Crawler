When we get back to work we realize both orders are mixed up and one order that was supposed to be salmon was not. So I called and spoke to the short brown skin woman and explain. We agreed that my co worker and I would go in on Monday to get our free meals. Well low and behold this woman shows up at my job with both of our orders done correctly!!! Talk about customer service and going above and beyond!! I didn't order anything else as our break was over so seeing her show up for us was amazing!!! I will see her on Monday to give her a tip on top of the hug I gave her. She was in a rush to get back to the store so no time then. I work in Customer service as well so to get it back the way I give it deserves a 5 star review!!!!"

I arrived, had to wait for the two ladies to finish what they were doing, and then served me. When I realized I'd been there for almost 25 minutes, I asked about my order. One of the two ladies responded rudely, and I instantly matched her energy. The manager has no authority there. Like I told you, your business may be great, but with such poor customer service, I doubt people will support you. The lady told her boss, \"By the way, she's Honduran,\" referring to me. And I am Honduran, very proud of it, and very well-educated. They need to improve their customer service and also clean and organize their establishment. Terrible service!\n\nAunque amo los açai bowls, no iría a este lugar y muchos menos lo recomendaría. El servicio es pésimo. Llegué, tuve que esperar a que las chicas terminaran de hacer órdenes que vi que estaban guardando y luego me atendieron a mi. Cuando me percaté que llevaba casi 25 min en el lugar pregunté por mi orden, una de las 2 chicas me respondió de mala manera, y pues yo pues le respondí de la misma manera. El manager no tiene autoridad en ese lugar, como te lo dije tu negocio podrá ser muy bueno pero con ese mal servicio al cliente que tienen dudo que la gente te va a apoyar. La chica le dijo a su jefe “por cierto, es hondureña” refiriéndose a mi persona. Y si soy hondureña y muy orgullosa de serlo, y con muy buena educación. Necesitan mejor su servicio al cliente y también limpiar y ordenar tu local. ¡Pésimo servicio!"

I placed my order over the phone I was told the price was $27.85 for 3 items when I got to the store to pick up.. my price doubled to $43.50. My food didn't come the way I placed my order. There is no broccoli or Chimchuri sauce my meal is very dry. I called to ask what happened just for the guy to tell me the broccoli is done. Which he still decided to make me pay my money just for a bunch of peppers that I don't eat. He told me i can come back next time , i dont not plan on ever going back to spend money with this place, I am Very upset\nMy salad isn't what I thought. This place is way to pricey and I did not get what I wanted with my food.\nVERY DISAPPOINTED"

When I first discovered Natural Squeeze over the summer, I loved it. However, my last four orders have been problematic.\n\nI had previously stopped going because my orders were frequently incorrect. After a few months, I decided to give them another try, hoping for improvement—but unfortunately, the issues persist.\n\nI always call ahead to place my order and am given a 10-minute estimate. However, even when I arrive after 20 minutes, I still end up waiting an additional 10 minutes. While the employees are kind, they often seem disorganized and unsure of why there’s a delay.\n\nI truly hope they can improve their efficiency because I would love to continue supporting this business."

Even if it’s my second time shopping or order in a day which would mean I do love this place. It’s a great soot overall I wish I would have worked out.
