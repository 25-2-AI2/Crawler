Let's start with the great parts of 21 GP: great decor, exceptional wines, killer burger, nachos that are flavorful w/ generous portion, the fries and dipping sauces, and the shrimp and grits!

Overall the quality of the food seems to have slipped over the past 6 months. Burgers have come out noticeably overcooked. Nachos have been soggy when they reach our table. But the main dealbreaker is the drastic drop in the quality of service. On our last two visits we have waited for over 45 minutes to get our food. The last visit was the worst. Our server was impossible to find for a majority of our visit and was obviously overwhelmed. We saw basically the whole patio around us get seated, get all of their food, and cash out before our mains even got to us. When asking what kind of water we wanted we asked for sparkling and did not realize that it was $10 bottle (not a huge deal, but let us know). After a 40 minute wait post-appetizer cleanup, we asked where our food was and we were informed by another server that it was ""up next"". When we finally did get the check (had to ask the other server before our server brought it) there was no acknowledgment of the wait or service. Nothing. Unacceptable at this price point with so many other great options nearby.",1430

The name of the restaurant is the address of the restaurant, makes it easy to find and to remember.

It was pretty packed, and seemed rather small. They had a bar right at the entry, and very small amount of seating... But, we discovered they actually have more seating in the back with bigger tables! The back room was very nice and cozy, quiet and relaxing. Well, until this room got filled up.

We ordered a few items since we were all hungry. We got a Special Pizza of the Day, which was white pizza with mozzarella, permesan, and pepperoni. It had quite the punch from the chili flakes, good and spicy!

We also ordered a Market Fish, which was Scottish trout. The fish was very much like salmon. It had great mix of fish and sweet watermelon!

The last item we ordered was Pork Chop New York. The pork chops was nothing like I imagined, and quite tasty! The meat was packed with flavor with perfect amount of seasoning.

For dessert, we asked what the “Seasonal Cobbler” is, and we were told it is apple and pear. It came out piping hot, rather small but since we were full, that was ok. It had some rosemary that added aroma and flavor which was quite pleasant. It was not too herb-y but just enough.

I was used to getting ice cream with cobbler in the past, but their cobbler does NOT come with ice cream. So, we added order of ice cream as well. We chose Vanilla and Blueberry Olive Oil ice cream. The ice cream came out first, and it took a while for the cobbler to come out. So about the time the cobbler finally reached our table, the ice creams were gone…

The service was good and friendly. We were taken care of nicely, felt welcomed in a relaxing atmosphere. It was a good find on the restaurant, with good food and service. The price point is rather high, though.",1884

My fiancé and I came here to cap off an amazing night. But little did we know we’d be dining at the most remarkably underwhelming restaurant in all of Brooklyn.

The service was dramatically slow which was laughable considering the restaurant was virtually empty. We waited a little over an hour for our food, and when it finally arrived it was a colossal disappointment. Calling the food bland is honestly an insult to bland food. No, it was more like dissatisfaction was the only seasoning they had in their spice rack that day. They have zero business pricing their entrees the way they do.
